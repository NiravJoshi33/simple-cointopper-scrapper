    "content": "A recent lawsuit against the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform PoolTogether has been dismissed by a United States judge. The judge ruled that the federal court system is not the appropriate venue to address concerns regarding the DeFi startup. U.S. district court Judge Frederic Block stated that while there were genuine concerns about the startup, a federal lawsuit was not a suitable method to address them. The plaintiff, Joseph Kent, lacked standing to pursue the lawsuit as he had not suffered any concrete harm from the defendants. The court order specified that Kent lacks standing to sue, and the defendants' motions to dismiss were granted on that basis. The alternative motions to compel arbitration were considered moot.\n\nWhile the lawsuit was dismissed, the judge stated that Kent is free to pursue his claims in state court, and any outstanding issues raised in the dismissal motions should be resolved by the New York Court of Appeals.The DeFi community celebrated the decision, with some individuals noting that their nonfungible tokens (NFTs) now have utility, while others expressed their support for the outcome.\n\nStay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool capable of generating convincing text, images, and videos. However, as Sam Altman wisely warned, this technology's potential for misuse can lead to significant problems. If AI goes wrong, the consequences can be disastrous. Let us delve into the far-reaching implications of AI misuse that threaten to disrupt societal harmony and erode public trust.Spreading Misinformation:A striking example of AI misuse is the circulation of counterfeit images on social media. One such incident involved a false depiction of a massive explosion near the Pentagon. Within minutes, the deceptive photo was shared by numerous social media accounts, including verified ones. The consequences were immediate and chaotic, leading to temporary market slumps and heightened disarray. This incident serves as a stark reminder of AI's capacity to disseminate misinformation and its potential to disrupt the flow of accurate information.\n\nThe misuse of AI technology presents profound implications for society. From the dissemination of counterfeit images to the generation of hallucinatory information, AI's dark side becomes evident. It is crucial that we recognize and address these challenges to ensure responsible and ethical use of AI. By doing so, we can safeguard the trust in our information sources, maintain social order, and protect ourselves from the detrimental consequences of AI gone wrong. Let us embrace the transformative power of AI while remaining vigilant in preventing its misuse.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more!",

Therefore, if the SEC's lawsuit is successful, Robinhood would need to delist these cryptocurrencies to comply with U.S. securities laws.The SEC argues that several widely traded cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Solana, and Polygon, are securities that have not been properly registered. This potential delisting of Cardano comes less than a year after it was added to the Robinhood platform, demonstrating a swift change in the regulatory landscape.Robinhood's decision to add ADA support in September 2022 was part of a broader expansion in their cryptocurrency offerings. However, with the SEC's legal actions, the fate of these cryptocurrencies on the Robinhood platform remains uncertain.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Key Points from 'Risk-Off Capital Rotation - Week 23, 2023' published by\u00a0On-chain analytics firm GlassnodeThe\u00a0analysis discusses the current state of the digital asset market, highlighting indicators of a risk-off rotation of capital and a preference for stablecoin capital. The price of Ethereum (ETH) has remained range-bound, with low volatility since mid-March. However, there are underlying shifts in market preference, including decreased trade volumes, increased automated usage of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and a growing preference for stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT).The\u00a0analysis explores the rise in automated arbitrage, driven by trading activity on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. The top traded pools on Uniswap reveal that the highest volumes are associated with larger market cap assets like ETH, stablecoins, and derivatives such as cbETH. The analysis indicates that a significant portion of Uniswap's trading volume is generated by MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bots engaging in arbitrage transactions.While trading bots may be perceived as harmful to Ethereum end-users, they provide benefits to Ethereum validators through increased rewards and MEV-boost payments. This trend favors staked ETH as a primary asset within the Ethereum ecosystem and establishes a hurdle rate for tokens seeking capital flows.Furthermore, the article discusses capital rotation moving towards stablecoins and Bitcoin (BTC) as liquidity decreases. Futures trading volume has contracted, indicating weak institutional interest and liquidity. On-chain data shows a shift in investor preference, with ETH's dominance in capital flows declining and a potential transition of capital back towards stablecoins.The analysis also mentions the outflows from stablecoins, primarily USDC and BUSD, potentially reflecting a geographical preference for USDT outside the US. Similarly, there is a reversal in supply dominance among different geographical regions for BTC.Overall, the trends suggest a risk-off environment with capital concentrating in more liquid assets, such as BTC, and a growing preference for stablecoins. The article highlights the influence of factors like interest rates, regulatory environments, and access to US capital markets on the market dynamics.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Lucy Powell, a politician and digital spokesperson for the UK's Labour Party, has expressed the view that artificial intelligence (AI) should be regulated and licensed similarly to the pharmaceutical, medical, and nuclear industries. Powell believes that companies like OpenAI and Google, which develop AI models, should be required to obtain licenses for building such models. She expressed concern over the lack of regulation for large language models that can be applied across various AI tools, emphasizing the need for governing their construction, management, and control.\n\nPowell suggested that regulating the development of AI technologies is a more viable option than an outright ban, drawing a parallel with the European Union's ban on facial recognition tools. She acknowledged that AI can have unintended consequences but argued that if developers were obligated to be transparent about their AI training models and datasets, some risks could be mitigated with government intervention.Powell emphasized the need for an active and interventionist government approach in light of the rapid advancement of AI technology. She also highlighted the potential impact of advanced technology on the UK economy. The Labour Party, reportedly finalizing its own policies on AI and related technologies, is planning a meeting with AI-focused executives at Google's UK offices, led by Labour leader Keir Starmer and the party's shadow cabinet.Overall, Powell's statements reflect her belief in the necessity of licensing and regulation for AI development, emphasizing the importance of transparency and government intervention to address potential risks and maximize the benefits of AI technology in the UK.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "JPMorgan has partnered with six Indian banks, including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, and its own banking unit in Gujurat, India, to settle interbank dollar transactions on its blockchain-based trading platform called Onyx. This collaboration, as reported by Bloomberg, aims to settle dollar trades in real time, 24 hours a day, throughout the week, instead of the usual settlement process that takes several days and is limited to working days.The project, which commenced recently, will be conducted as a pilot over the upcoming months. Onyx, established in 2020, serves as JPMorgan's digital assets network for facilitating wholesale payment transactions. The initiative is centered at the Gujurat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City), an Indian development striving to establish an international finance hub comparable to global financial centers like Singapore and Dubai.By leveraging blockchain technology, JPMorgan and the collaborating Indian banks seek to enhance the efficiency and speed of interbank dollar settlements. The traditional settlement process often involves intermediaries and manual procedures, leading to delays and potential errors. Real-time settlement on the Onyx blockchain system could streamline and automate the process, reducing costs and risks associated with interbank transactions.This collaboration demonstrates JPMorgan's commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for improving financial services, while also supporting India's ambition to become a prominent player in the international finance sector.

    "content": "In a surprising turn of events, a crypto influencer named Paul tweeted an address where he promised to give absolutely nothing in return for sending Ethereum (ETH). Despite the lack of any reward or benefit, the address has received an astonishing amount of cryptocurrencies, accumulating over $1.1 million in less than 24 hours.\n\nAs of now, the address has received over 1000 transfers, with the largest known transaction being around $13,000 worth of ETH from a wallet named \"Maverick_time\" on the OpenSea platform. The motives behind this flood of transfers remain unclear, leaving many to speculate about the reasons behind such a phenomenon.Some suggest that people might be driven by a desire to be part of an exclusive or viral trend, blindly following the crowd without expecting anything in return. On the other hand, some transfers could be seen as humorous or intended as a tribute to the original tweet, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the crypto community.The incident highlights the irrational and unpredictable behavior that can occur within the crypto space. It serves as a reminder that the market can be influenced by factors beyond traditional logic and reasoning. Ultimately, this peculiar event showcases the unique dynamics and social phenomena that can arise in the world of cryptocurrencies.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

He emphasized the challenges faced by businesses due to currency differences and the need to move away from a dollar-dominated environment.By adopting PAPSS, businesses can focus on goods and services while leaving currency complexities to Afreximbank. The system's support from African central banks adds credibility and potential for widespread adoption.Ruto's call reflects a desire for economic autonomy and regional integration, aiming to boost intra-African trade and reduce dependency on external currencies, thereby promoting economic growth and stability on the continent.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Venture capitalist Arthur Cheong believes that despite the slow market conditions in the crypto industry, two sectors are thriving and offer potential rewards for those who pay attention. According to Cheong, liquid staking and decentralized derivatives exchanges are worth noting.\n\nIn the case of liquid staking, Cheong points out that the queue time to stake Ethereum (ETH) is currently over 40 days, indicating high demand that surpasses the available supply. This suggests a strong growth potential for liquid staking as more individuals seek to stake their ETH.Regarding decentralized derivatives exchanges, Cheong highlights the impressive products being developed by some of the best-decentralized finance (DeFi) teams. He notes that even in a bear market, these exchanges generate annual revenues of $10-$15 billion. This indicates the resilience and profitability of the sector, further reinforcing its growth potential.Cheong also mentions on Twitter that the ratio of decentralized exchange volumes relative to centralized exchanges is at an all-time high. He predicts a future where crypto exchanges will be polarized, with extremely compliant exchanges implementing strict rules akin to traditional finance brokers, while decentralized exchange protocols will operate outside the regulatory framework designed for financial intermediaries.\n\nOverall, Cheong's analysis suggests that liquid staking and decentralized derivatives exchanges are thriving and offer lucrative opportunities, despite the overall market conditions in the crypto industry. Those who pay attention and are willing to take risks in these sectors may be well rewarded in the future. do your own research before investing in crypto.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

In an op-ed for MarketWatch, Armstrong expressed his concern that the lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. crypto industry could lead to the country losing its status as a financial leader and innovation hub. He emphasized that cryptocurrencies are not just about individual transactions but are a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including finance, supply chains, and social media. Armstrong also highlighted the importance of providing creators with royalties for secondary market transactions.\n\nArmstrong has been a vocal advocate for regulatory clarity in the crypto industry, urging policymakers to support its potential while protecting consumers. He specifically mentioned Coinbase's request for clarity from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the classification of digital assets as securities.\u00a0Armstrong noted that China, with its launch of the digital yuan and efforts to challenge the U.S. as the global financial leader, is positioning Hong Kong as a global crypto hub. He warned that if the U.S. fails to pass comprehensive crypto legislation, it would need to catch up and invest billions to regain its innovation standing. However, Armstrong acknowledged that even with significant efforts, it might be too late for the U.S. to recover its position.In summary, Armstrong believes that the U.S. should provide regulatory clarity to the crypto industry to prevent potential benefits for countries like China and to maintain its position as a leader in finance and innovation.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

The report also projects that the tokenization scene will reach a valuation of $16 trillion by 2030.The report, the second in a series, provides insights into global sentiments towards cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and blockchain technology. It surveyed over 1,700 finance leaders from financial institutions and enterprises, focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and payments.One of the key findings is that payments are the most mature and widely adopted use case for digital assets. The majority of individuals involved in the crypto scene use digital assets for payments. The survey reveals that 44% of global finance leaders see payments as the gateway to crypto adoption, emphasizing faster payments and cost-effectiveness as the main value proposition for integrating cryptocurrencies into cross-border transactions.Another significant finding is the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) among financial institutions.

    "content": "Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase, has raised concerns about the possibility of the US government using tech giants like Apple and Google to gain access to citizens' cryptocurrency wallets. Srinivasan believes that as world governments face potential bankruptcy in the coming decade, they might resort to seizing Bitcoin in order to fund their operations. While he doesn't believe the US government has the capability to execute a 51% attack on Bitcoin, he suggests that China could potentially do so, although it is less likely now due to most mining occurring outside of Chinese borders.According to Srinivasan, the real \"systemic risks\" for cryptocurrencies lie with companies like Apple and Google. He speculates that the government might attempt to compel these tech companies to search for private keys on servers, devices, and browsers under their control, and to transfer any stolen funds to the federal government. Srinivasan describes this as cyberwar rather than cyberterrorism, emphasizing that it involves the CEO of a company giving lawful orders to hack their customers. He compares this to a situation in early 2022 when tech companies in Russia turned against their former customers, who were designated enemies of the state.\n\nIn March, Srinivasan gained attention in the crypto world by betting a million dollars that Bitcoin would reach $1 million within 90 days, as a response to failing banks and hyperinflation. Although the price of Bitcoin was around $27,000 at the time of the bet and remained at a similar level when he closed the wager by paying out $1.5 million, Srinivasan claimed that his intention was to raise public awareness about the US Federal Reserve's monetary policies.",

He expressed his belief in including digital currency in property registration during a press conference at the Sejong Government Complex on May 17. The prime minister emphasized the importance of discussing and deciding on this matter in the National Assembly.

Currently, there are no requirements for officials to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings, and each individual can decide independently whether to reveal such assets.It remains to be seen how the National Assembly will respond to the prime minister's call. If cryptocurrency is included in property registrations, it would bring greater visibility and accountability to the holdings of high-ranking officials. This move could help prevent conflicts of interest and potential illicit activities involving digital currencies.As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow and gain mainstream attention, governments around the world are grappling with regulatory frameworks to address its unique challenges. Ensuring transparency and preventing financial crimes, such as money laundering and fraud, are key concerns for policymakers.In conclusion, South Korean Prime Minister Han Deok-soo has called for the disclosure and registration of cryptocurrency assets by high-ranking public officials. This proposal aims to address concerns surrounding the transparency of officials' holdings and prevent potential illicit activities involving digital currencies. By implementing this measure, South Korea seeks to promote accountability and set an example for other countries in regulating the cryptocurrency market. The response from the National Assembly will determine the future of this proposal and its impact on the country's cryptocurrency landscape.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

The white paper had been included in all versions of the Mac operating system since 2018, and was found within a test scanner app called Virtual Scanner II. It's still unclear why the white paper was included in the app, but it was believed to be a joke among Apple engineers.The Bitcoin white paper PDF, authored by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, was discovered by technologist Andy Baio in every copy of MacOS over the past five years. The document had been hiding in plain sight, within the Virtual Scanner II app, and nobody had any idea why it was there.Some people have speculated that the inclusion of the white paper was a nod to the growing interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, or that it was a tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto, who is still unknown to this day. Other, wilder conspiracy theories have even emerged, such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs being Satoshi Nakamoto. However, there is no evidence to support these claims.Despite the various theories, it seems that Apple has now decided to remove the white paper from the latest version of the Mac operating system. While some people may be disappointed by this decision, it's important to note that Apple has not provided any explanation for why it made this move.\n\nIt's unclear what this means for the future of cryptocurrencies on Apple's platforms, or if there will be any further changes to the way that the company approaches Bitcoin and other digital currencies. For now, it seems that we'll just have to wait and see what happens next.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) are two of the hottest buzzwords in the tech industry right now. Unfortunately, it seems that some unscrupulous individuals and companies are taking advantage of the hype around these technologies to deceive and defraud would-be investors.This week, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) announced its latest efforts to protect residents from crypto scams. The agency sent cease and desist letters to five companies, accusing them of attempting to profit from the AI hype train.\n\nThe companies in question are Maxpread Technologies, Harvest Keeper, Visque Capital, Coinbot, and QuantFund. The DFPI claims that each of these companies offered unqualified securities and made false promises to investors. They allegedly made exaggerated claims about generating high returns using AI for crypto trading, and used multi-level marketing tactics to lure in unsuspecting victims.One of the most shocking allegations involves Maxpread Technologies, which is accused of attempting to deceive investors about the identity of its CEO. The company allegedly used an AI-generated avatar to create a fake CEO that recited a scripted message to potential investors.This isn't the first time that regulators have cracked down on crypto scams. In fact, the DFPI has already taken action against dozens of companies that have tried to profit from the cryptocurrency craze. But the use of AI in these scams is a new development that highlights the need for greater scrutiny of emerging technologies.AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including finance and investing. But as with any powerful tool, it can also be misused by those with nefarious intentions. As AI continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, it's likely that we'll see more attempts to use it for fraudulent purposes.Regulators like the DFPI play an important role in protecting consumers from these scams. By cracking down on fraudulent companies and holding them accountable for their actions, they send a message that this kind of behavior won't be tolerated.Investors also have a role to play in protecting themselves. By doing their due diligence and researching companies before investing, they can avoid falling victim to these kinds of scams.

    "content": "Bitcoin has been making headlines for its impressive rally this year, but according to Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone, there's a catch. McGlone is very bullish on Bitcoin's prospects over the long term, citing its definable diminishing supply and early days of adoption as major reasons to be long over time. However, he warns that risk assets, including Bitcoin, face significant headwinds going forward.According to McGlone, Bitcoin's recent price gains are attributable to a \"bear market rally,\" and when other correlated assets start declining in value in case a recession hits, Bitcoin will follow suit. He believes that Bitcoin is still a risky asset and that it's impossible to get a significant contraction in risk asset prices without Bitcoin going down.Despite the short-term risks, McGlone believes that Bitcoin will trade like a safe haven over the long term. He thinks that Bitcoin will come out ahead and trade more like gold and long bonds as a risk-off asset. However, it's still a very risky asset, and investors should be cautious.Bitcoin's recent price movements have been impressive, with the flagship crypto asset rallying by nearly 90% this year to 2023 high of $31,000 reached earlier this month. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $28,880.Overall, while Bitcoin's long-term prospects may look promising, investors should be aware of the risks involved in investing in this volatile asset.

    "content": "On April 18th, a series of mysterious tweets featuring orange balls were posted by the crypto arm of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16z). These cryptic tweets led to a lot of speculation in the crypto community about what they could be hinting at. However, it was later revealed that these tweets were building up hype for a new rollup client for Optimism (OP) called \"Magi\".\n\nMagi is a client for the Ethereum layer-2 solution Optimism, which is designed to help simplify the process of creating layer-2 blockchains. It is written in the programming language Rust and is intended to improve the client diversity and resilience of the entire OP Stack ecosystem.The OP Stack is the set of software that powers the Ethereum layer-2 solution Optimism. Magi takes the place of a consensus client, which is often called a rollup client, in the OP Stack, and works alongside an execution client such as op-geth to sync. This means that it allows the Ethereum chain to advance by feeding new blocks to the execution client.\n\nJesse Pollak, the lead engineer for Coinbase's layer-2 solution Base, also weighed in on the announcement, tweeting that \"magi means more decentralization, security, and scale for the OP Stack.\" This is because decentralization increases network security, which is critically important for rollups, just as it is for the base layer of Ethereum.In a blog post, Noah Citron, an engineer at A16z, explained that Magi is still in development and, while it can currently sync to the Optimism testnet, it will be some months before it is production-ready. He also noted that Magi's development is a step towards improving the overall resilience and diversity of the OP Stack ecosystem.This announcement from A16z echoes the way Coinbase introduced its own layering network called Base, which featured tweets of a blue circle. While the hype around the orange balls may have led to speculation about another Ethereum layer-2 solution being imminent, it turns out that they were simply building up hype for Magi, a new rollup client for Optimism.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Cybercriminals are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to exploit the digital world, and cryptocurrency has emerged as a lucrative target. With the rise of digital assets, crypto phishing attacks have increased by 40% in 2022, as compared to the previous year, according to Russian cybersecurity and anti-virus provider Kaspersky.Instead of using traditional financial threats such as banking malware, bad actors are focusing on phishing scams to obtain investors' personal information and access their crypto wallets and assets. These attacks usually involve the creation of fake websites and communication channels that mimic legitimate companies, luring unsuspecting investors to share their private keys.In a survey conducted by Kaspersky, one out of seven respondents admitted to being affected by cryptocurrency phishing attacks. Scammers are continually evolving their strategies and using innovative techniques to trick unwary crypto investors. Despite warnings from experts, crypto remains an attractive target for those seeking to get rich quickly with minimal effort.In March 2023, hardware cryptocurrency wallet provider Trezor issued a warning against attempts to steal users' crypto by tricking investors into entering their recovery phrase on a fake Trezor site. This highlights the importance of staying vigilant and adopting best practices when it comes to securing digital assets.While Kaspersky cannot predict if the trend of crypto phishing attacks will continue in the future, it is essential to be aware of the risks and take steps to protect oneself. By finding out more about the latest news on cyberattacks in the cryptocurrency space, you can stay informed and take the necessary precautions to safeguard your investments.Check out this article for tips and stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

The suspect, Nima Momeni, a 38-year-old tech consultant, and entrepreneur, was taken into custody by law enforcement agents following the stabbing incident in the Rincon Hill neighborhood.The case is still under investigation, and prosecutors have not disclosed the motive behind the crime. However, it is worth noting that Momeni changed his behavior in the days after the murder.This incident has prompted criticism of San Francisco for its high crime rates, with many prominent individuals, including Elon Musk, expressing their concern. However, San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott believes that the murder could have happened anywhere, and it was more about human behavior than the city itself.Unfortunately, Lee's death is not the only tragic incident to have occurred in the crypto industry recently. The co-founder of the crypto firm Amber Group, Tiantian Kullander, passed away in his sleep at the age of 30 last year, while the 53-year-old Russian \"billionaire crypto businessman\" Vyacheslav Taran died in a helicopter crash in Switzerland.These incidents serve as a reminder that tragedy can strike anywhere, and it is important to stay vigilant and take care of one another.

According to a statement released by the company's CEO, Emmanuel Njoku, the decision to shut down the startup was made after the company failed to raise funds in a funding round.\n\nThe shutdown comes just a few months after the company announced layoffs in November 2022 due to its inability to raise funds after a lead investor pulled out.To ensure a seamless transition for its users, Lazerpay is advising merchants to use the bank or crypto payout options and withdraw their funds from the platform before April 30, 2023. Additionally, the startup is now inviting companies to make offers to purchase its intellectual property.Lazerpay was co-founded by Njoku, Abdulfatai Suleiman, and Prosper Ubi in October 2021 to drive crypto adoption globally. The company helps businesses accept stablecoin payments from customers globally and has onboarded over 3,000 businesses, processing over $1 million in transactions.The shutdown of Lazerpay is another example of the challenges that startups in the African crypto space are facing.

According to a Bloomberg report, The CFTC has filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, alleging that the company and its top executive broke several U.S. regulatory rules. These include failure to prevent U.S. citizens from trading on the platform and failure to register with the regulator.The CFTC's Chairman, Rostin Behnam, has accused Binance of breaking international rules and called on the company to comply with U.S. regulations if it wants to continue its operations in the United States. In addition to the CFTC's lawsuit, Binance is also under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and federal prosecutors for compliance with anti-money laundering obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also investigating whether Binance facilitated unregistered securities trading.The regulatory scrutiny of Binance is part of a broader crackdown by U.S. regulators on the cryptocurrency industry. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has warned that several digital assets may resemble unregistered securities and has taken swift action against major crypto firms like Kraken over compliance issues.As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, it is important for cryptocurrency exchanges to remain aware of the concerns of regulatory bodies and take the necessary steps to address them.

    "content": "In the world of venture capitalism, crypto firms have been experiencing a slowdown in funding during the first quarter of 2023. However, a new report from Galaxy Research suggests that this could change in the second quarter, with the recent surge in crypto prices potentially bringing about a rebound in VC activity.Despite regulatory turbulence surrounding the crypto industry in the United States, the country remains the top destination for firms looking to raise capital. Galaxy Research's report revealed that out of the $2.4 billion invested by VCs in Q1 2023, the majority went to US-based firms.It's worth noting that data on venture deals is often revised at a later date, so the $2.4 billion figure may change in the future. Nonetheless, the report highlights that while VC investments have been declining since reaching a peak of almost $13 billion in Q1 2022, the number of deals made has actually increased by almost 20%.This suggests that while the total amount of capital invested has fallen, there are still opportunities for crypto firms to secure funding from VCs. Furthermore, with crypto prices experiencing a boost in late Q1 2023, there could be a correlation between price gains and VC activity.However, it's important to note that the report does not provide any financial advice, and investors should always conduct their own research before making any investment decisions. While the potential for a rebound in VC activity is promising, the crypto industry remains volatile and subject to regulatory uncertainty.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more information.\u00a0",

This move indicates that Musk is committed to furthering his AI infrastructure and exploring the potential of AI in detecting and highlighting manipulation of public opinion on Twitter.Typically, GPUs are used for large-scale AI models due to the significant computation power required by the technology. While the project is reportedly in its early stages, the purchase of such a large quantity of GPUs shows that Musk is dedicated to the initiative.Sources have indicated that the project involves a large language model, but the specific role of generative AI at Twitter remains unclear.

    "content": "Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a well-known venture capital firm, recently published its second annual \"State of Crypto\" report, which emphasizes the significance of Web3, blockchain infrastructure, and a price-innovation cycle. The report argues that the bear market provides an ideal time for builders, especially for blockchain infrastructure projects.The report also unveiled a new State of Crypto Index, an interactive tool that tracks 14 technology-focused metrics every month to provide a snapshot of the industry's health. According to the report, the imbalance between the noise of fleeting price movements and the data that tracks the signals that matter is causing confusion. The report shows that the progress of Web3 technology is durable and reflects a healthier industry than market prices indicate, with ongoing innovation, product launches, and development.The report highlights the failures of centralized systems and the open, resilient nature of decentralized infrastructure, demonstrated by the headline-grabbing scandals and collapses of the past year. Web3 is described as \"more than a financial movement, it's an evolution of the internet\" that advances the internet through \"crypto computers, not crypto casinos.\"The advantages of Web3 over prior technological models include decentralized blockchain networks, community-governed nature, the lack of power consolidation among corporations, and value occurring to network participants. Although Web3 adoption is still in its early stages, the report notes that decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) metrics have become more stable after falling from record highs in 2021, with gaming showing particular strength.The report also highlights the ongoing improvements in blockchain infrastructure, including new layer 1 chains that improve scalability and programmability, as well as layer 2 scaling systems such as optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups. The firm is particularly optimistic about zero-knowledge proofs, a method of computationally verifying that a transaction is valid.The price-innovation cycle states that market downturns bring more dedicated developers into the crypto space, and then the excitement around those projects eventually begins to drive asset prices higher. \"Product cycles are where new things that lead to consistent and more robust growth over many years are occurring, regardless of financial cycles,\" says A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin.In conclusion, a16z's \"State of Crypto\" report reflects the significant potential of Web3 and blockchain infrastructure, as well as the ongoing progress and innovation in the industry.

The network saw a surge in user activity in March, with the number of UAWs engaging with games on Polygon increasing by 53% from February, according to the \"Blockchain Games Report\" by DappRadar.Polygon overtook Hive for the second spot last month, with the Hunters On-Chain RPG partly driving the growth in UAWs. The game saw a UAW increase of more than 17,000% over the past 30 days alone, according to DappRadar data. Hunters On-Chain is a free-to-play role-playing game with non-fungible token (NFT) integrations and a similar look and style to Minecraft. It is unclear what specifically drove the surge in interest for the game last month, although anticipation for an in-game NFT sale on March 31 may have been a contributing factor.While all on-chain gaming activity decreased by 3.33% in March to 741,567 daily Unique Active Wallets (dUAW), games still make up 45.6% of the DApp industry activity in Q1 2023, the report noted.Polygon Labs, the team behind the network, has notched a long list of big-name partnerships, such as Warner Music, Starbucks, Adidas, Reddit, and Adobe, to develop and host NFT projects. The team also successfully launched Polygon's open-source Ethereum Virtual Machine equivalent zero-knowledge rollup on March 27, which is touted to allow DApps to scale through transaction batching, unlocking higher performance while reducing gas fees to conduct transactions on the network.The surge in user activity on Polygon and the success of Hunters On-Chain is a positive sign for the network, which is gaining recognition as a gaming blockchain. Polygon's bullish momentum in NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse continues, and it will be interesting to see how the network evolves in the coming months.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

According to a recent discovery, the document is actually included in every modern copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018. The PDF version of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin whitepaper is apparently found in every version of macOS from Mojave to the current Ventura version, but not in High Sierra or earlier versions.To check for yourself, simply open Terminal and type in the command:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0open /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdfor navigate to the file directly in Finder. The Bitcoin PDF should open in Preview immediately for macOS 10.14 or later. However, the reason behind this inclusion is still unknown. The whitepaper is used as a sample document for a device called \u201cVirtual Scanner II\u201d in the Image Capture utility, which is either hidden or not installed by default for everyone. Some have speculated that it may power the \u201cImport from iPhone\u201d feature.Josh D. has shared this over Twitter,\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, the file is named \u201csimpledoc.pdf\u201d and is only 184 KB. It could have just been a lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes.

    "content": "In recent news, Robinhood has been fined up to $10.2 million by regulators in multiple US states over technical failures that caused harm to investors. This settlement comes after an investigation into Robinhood's platform outages in March 2020 by regulators in California, Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Texas. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) has joined the multi-state settlement.According to the DFPI, Robinhood had deficiencies in its review and approval process for options and margin accounts, weaknesses in the firm\u2019s monitoring and reporting tools, and insufficient customer service and escalation protocols that left Robinhood users unable to process trades. This is not the first time Robinhood has faced such a penalty, as it had already paid a $30 million settlement to the New York State Department of Financial Services in 2021 and a $65 million payment to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020. The platform was also fined $70 million by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for failing to protect customers.The regulatory penalties that Robinhood is facing may raise concerns among investors and traders who rely on the platform for their financial activities. The penalties may also impact the reputation of the company, especially since this is not the first time it has faced such charges.Regulators have urged Robinhood to take its customer care obligations seriously and correct these deficiencies. As a result, the platform may have to reassess its operational procedures and strengthen its protocols to avoid further regulatory penalties in the future. Investors and traders who use Robinhood may also need to be cautious and stay updated on any developments that may affect their financial activities.In conclusion, the recent penalties faced by Robinhood highlight the importance of regulatory compliance and customer care in the financial industry. Companies that fail to meet these obligations may face significant penalties and reputational damage. Investors and traders must remain vigilant and informed of any regulatory developments that may affect their financial activities.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Artificial intelligence has been a hot topic in the tech industry since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. While the competition among major technology companies is intensifying, concerns are also growing about privacy violations and ethical/social issues related to the black box nature of AI internal structures and operating principles that cannot be observed from the outside.Recently, Canadian authorities launched an investigation into OpenAI's ChatGPT, following complaints that it collects, uses, and discloses personal information without consent. ChatGPT is a chatbot that provides conversational answers to user queries by using information from the internet. It has attracted over 100 million monthly users since its launch, with Microsoft integrating its AI technology into search engines and office software.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT faced a leak of customer information on March 20, which led to OpenAI taking the service offline to deal with the bug. The leaked information included personal details like credit card numbers and addresses of some paid users. The Canadian Personal Information Protection Commission (CPC) Chair, Philippe Dufresne, emphasized the importance of staying ahead of \"fast-moving technological advances\" and that the privacy impact of artificial intelligence is a top priority.Governments around the world are considering ways to regulate generative AI software like ChatGPT. In the United States, President Joe Biden and the Science and Technology Advisory Council met on the 4th to discuss the risks and opportunities associated with artificial intelligence development. President Biden emphasized the need to address potential social, economic, and national security risks associated with AI, and urged Congress to pass legislation to ensure responsible innovation and adequate safeguards to protect children and curb data collection.\n\nIn conclusion, as AI technology continues to advance, it is crucial to ensure that proper measures are in place to safeguard users' privacy and security. As such, both government bodies and technology companies need to work together to ensure responsible innovation and the development of AI technology that is ethical and socially responsible.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

However, the situation seems to have taken a positive turn as the hacker has returned a significant portion of the funds after accepting the project's offer for a \"white hat bounty.\"\n\nAllbridge announced on April 3 that it had received a message from an individual, and 1,500 Binance Coin (BNB) worth around $465,000, had been returned to the project. The remaining funds will be considered a white hat bounty to the individual. Allbridge converted the BNB received to the stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD) to be used as compensation.The attack was first identified on April 1 by blockchain security firm Peckshield. It warned Allbridge in a tweet that its BNB Chain pools swap price was being manipulated by an individual acting as a liquidity provider and swapper. Following the exploit, Allbridge offered the attacker a bounty and the chance to escape any legal ramifications.\n\nWhile Allbridge has not publicly disclosed the total amount stolen, blockchain security firm CertiK estimated the sum to be close to $550,000, while Peckshield claimed the exploit netted $282,889 in BUSD and $290,868 worth of Tether (USDT), totaling roughly $573,000.Allbridge also revealed that a second address was used to carry out the same exploit, and it has asked the exploiter to return the stolen funds.Following the initial attack, Allbridge made it clear that they were working with various organizations to retrieve the stolen funds, and BNB Chain was among those who answered the call. In an April 2 tweet, BNB Chain reported that it had discovered at least one of the culprits involved through on-chain analysis and is actively supporting the Allbridge team on the fund recovery. It also gave a shout-out to AvengerDAO for its efforts in the recovery.\n\nOverall, the situation serves as a reminder of the importance of security measures in the world of cryptocurrency.\u00a0Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

The service was initiated by \"DeFi Dude,\" who explained that the project was aimed at making archive data accessible to individuals who lacked the time, money, or resources to run their own archive node.Archive nodes are instances of Ethereum clients configured to create archives of all historical states of the blockchain. These nodes are useful for querying historical blockchain data that is not accessible on full nodes. Archive nodes require much greater storage capacity and are not required to participate in block validation, which means that they can be built from scratch.According to \"DeFi Dude,\" the project was a success and the service is no longer necessary since there are now other alternatives available that did not exist when the project started.

    "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed the addition of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zk-EVMs) at the protocol level, which could significantly speed up the verification process on the base blockchain. In a recent post, Buterin explained that integrating a zk-EVM on the base layer would not compromise decentralization or security. The technology would enable Ethereum Virtual Machines to execute smart contracts on the blockchain with ZK proofs.\n\nButerin highlighted that Ethereum was developed with a \u201cmulti-client philosophy\u201d to ensure decentralization at the protocol level. Integrating zk-EVMs at the Ethereum layer 1 would make it the third type of client, alongside the \u201cconsensus\u201d and \u201cexecution\u201d clients. By adding zk-EVM verification at the Ethereum base layer, Buterin suggested that it might be the solution to \u201cThe Verge,\u201d a part of the Ethereum roadmap that aims to make verification at the base layer easier.While there are some potential challenges with data inefficiency and latency issues with the zk-EVM infrastructure, Buterin believes that they can be overcome. Moreover, he suggested that zk-EVMs would make running a full node on Ethereum even easier. If implemented, the zk-EVM ecosystem would make Ethereum blocks smaller, which would enable anyone to run a fully verifying node on their laptop or even their phone or inside a browser extension.Several companies, including Polygon, StarkWare, ConsenSys, Scroll, zkSync, and Immutable, are deploying similar zk-EVM scaling solutions. While this is not financial advice, it is exciting to see technological advancements that could lead to a more decentralized and accessible blockchain infrastructure.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we interact and transact with each other. One of its key features is decentralization, which ensures transparency, security, and trustworthiness of the network.Recently, a tweet by Chris Blec highlighted that there is nothing decentralized about Arbitrum or Optimism, which are Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. He explained that even though users can access the network without permission, it does not make it decentralized. These networks have the power to halt the chain, modify any code, censor transactions, freeze wallets, or steal from the DAO, making them centralized.\n\nCentralization means that a single entity or group has control over the network, which contradicts the fundamental principles of blockchain technology. It goes against creating a trustless, decentralized network, and can lead to manipulation, censorship, or even network shutdown. While these networks offer some benefits, it's essential to exercise caution when using them and keep true decentralization in mind.The tweet serves as a reminder of the importance of decentralization in the blockchain world.

    "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is continually evolving, and the players in the industry must adapt to stay ahead. One of the key players in the cryptocurrency wallet industry, Ledger, recently announced the closure of its Series C funding round, raising a whopping $108.8 million. The funding will help accelerate the development of new secure consumer devices that can cater to the growing number of users exploring digital assets and blockchain-enabled technology.\n\nLedger is based in Paris, and the Chairman and CEO, Pascal Gauthier, announced the latest funding round on Thursday. Both long-term investors and new investors participated in the funding round, although the CEO did not disclose the amount each investor contributed. However, according to reports, the company raised \u20ac100 million, equivalent to $108.8 million, with new investors including True Global Ventures, Digital Finance Group, and VaynerFund, while existing investors include 10T, Cite\u0301 Gestion Private Bank, Cap Horn, Morgan Creek, Cathay Innovation, Korelya Capital, and Molten Ventures.Ledger's recent funding round comes despite the challenging funding environment that the industry is facing, prompted by regulatory and legal issues. However, the collapse of several major centralized companies has led many digital asset owners to seek safety in cold wallets. Gauthier noted in an interview with Bloomberg that people have come to realize that leaving crypto on an exchange is dangerous, and in 2023, even leaving money at a Swiss bank could be equally risky. As a result, Ledger has seen a surge in demand for its cold wallets.The CEO also acknowledged the significant turmoil the crypto industry has experienced over the past year, including the collapse of major crypto exchanges and shifting macroeconomic conditions. However, he notes that the rise of the Internet of Value will reshape how billions of people own and manage their assets, redefining how we interact with the Internet, the role of intermediaries, the global economy, and every industry.For this reason, a new generation of hardware is needed, which is why Ledger unveiled its Ledger Stax in December, designed by Tony Fadell, the co-inventor and designer of the iPod and iPhone. According to Gauthier, Ledger's devices will allow users to manage an ever-expanding range of tokenized assets, including value, identity, data, stocks, and much more, enabling them to connect with complete ownership.Ledger's future plans include upgrading software, integrating new coins, blockchains, services, and features into Ledger Live, and enabling an increasing range of corporations to leverage digital value through its branch dedicated to businesses, Ledger Enterprise. The company plans to have a second close for the funding round in mid-April and a third due to high investor interest.In conclusion, Ledger's latest funding round is a testament to the growing demand for secure cryptocurrency wallets as the industry continues to evolve. The rise of the Internet of Value presents a significant opportunity for the industry, and companies like Ledger must continue to innovate to stay ahead of the curve. With the new funding, Ledger can accelerate the development of new secure consumer devices, which will help expand the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the years to come.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "article_url": "https://cointopper.com/news/kyc-in-defi-is-it-the-solution-to-tackle-anti-money-laundering-issues",
    "publish_date": "March 30, 2023",
    "content": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is revolutionizing the finance industry by offering financial services that are free from central authorities and intermediaries. However, with the advantages of DeFi come challenges, particularly in terms of security and compliance. As the industry grows, so does the risk of money laundering, making Know Your Customer (KYC) measures increasingly relevant.During a panel session at the World of Web3 (WOW) Summit in Hong Kong, DeFi industry executives endorsed KYC in DeFi as a solution to tackle Anti-Money Laundering (AML) issues. The industry leaders argued that KYC measures would address the biggest issue in DeFi, which is hackers laundering millions of stolen funds into \u201cclean money.\u201d\n\nDyma Budorin, CEO of Hacken, warned of the prevalence of tools readily available to hackers to launder money stolen from DeFi platforms. Budorin described this as the \"biggest issue\" in the industry. He explained that hackers can easily steal millions of dollars and launder the funds into various wallets to make clean money again, making it difficult to track the source of the funds.However, some DeFi industry executives believe that KYC alone won't solve all AML problems. Victor Yim, head of fintech at Cyberport, Hong Kong's incubator for entrepreneurship, said that even in traditional finance, where KYC measures are prominent, \"there is still money laundering happening every day.\"Despite this, Yim believes KYC measures will make a \u201cbetter tomorrow\u201d for the DeFi industry. He added that it will require a collective effort, including \"regulators, policy, bureau and other players,\" to execute successfully. Yim cited the concept of \"anonymous traceable\" as an example of a balance between anonymity and compliance, with individuals remaining anonymous unless called upon by law enforcement.Alexander Scheer, founder of zkMe, emphasized that different mechanisms should be used for different solutions. For example, crypto mixers need to be handled completely differently to DeFi front-ends, on- and off-ramps.Scheer also touched on regulations, stating that the DeFi industry should proactively take the lead and \"front run\" regulations before they are imposed by regulators.While some may have concerns about privacy and data protection, the industry leaders argued that KYC is about transparency and accountability. Budorin said, \"KYC is about transparency and accountability. I don't think it's an issue for a majority of people. I'm sure 99% of people don't have things to hide. I'm happy to see it as part of our world.\"In conclusion, DeFi industry executives believe that KYC measures can help tackle AML issues and promote a more secure and compliant industry. While KYC alone may not solve all AML problems, it is an essential step towards building a better tomorrow for the DeFi industry.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

Srinivasan echoed this sentiment, writing: \"Freedom will push back, at national and state level.\"Srinivasan's comments come amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency sector, with many governments seeking to clamp down on what they see as a threat to financial stability.

    "content": "Mike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital, has expressed concern over the government's focus on regulating crypto rather than artificial intelligence (AI). Novogratz believes that AI is a technology that could trigger a \"deep fake\" identity crisis, yet regulators seem to be turning a blind eye to it.Novogratz explained during the firm's fourth-quarter conference call that the U.S. government has it \"completely upside-down\" in choosing to focus so much on crypto regulation and nothing on AI regulation. He fears that the rise of AI technology could lead to a crisis where it becomes difficult to prove one's identity.He suggests that blockchain-based applications could play a \"huge role\" in combating some of the issues presented by AI. He believes that crypto and blockchain could be an excellent use case for identity verification around AI.The fear of AI causing an identity crisis stems from the technology's ability to create fake personas, or \"deep fakes.\" In a world where deep fakes become more common, it becomes challenging to prove one's identity, and this could have disastrous consequences.Novogratz believes that the government should be focusing more on regulating AI to prevent such a crisis from happening. He suggests that regulating crypto should not be the top priority.He is optimistic about the future of the crypto market, believing that it will continue to grow throughout 2023. Novogratz thinks that China's recent decision to ease regulations on tech companies has led to an increase in crypto activity. He believes that the market feels strong, and from a technical standpoint, it is expected to continue its upward trajectory throughout the remainder of 2023.In conclusion, Novogratz believes that the government's focus on regulating crypto should not come at the expense of regulating AI. He thinks that blockchain-based applications could help combat some of the issues presented by AI, and that the crypto market has a bright future aheadStay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "Cardano could soon see greater flexibility in its smart contract wallets, as dcSpark, a crypto ecosystem builder focused on Cardano, Algorand, and Mina, is working to bring account abstraction to the Cardano ecosystem. In a tweet on Monday, dcSpark announced that it is working on account abstraction, which aims to treat smart contracts the same as regular user wallets. To achieve this, the company has submitted a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) dubbed CIP-0038. According to dcSpark\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Sebastien Guillemot, account abstraction can simplify coding on the blockchain and allow for the creation of smart contract wallets.\n\nOne of the main benefits of account abstraction is its potential to simplify the process of wallet recovery. Traditionally, to recover a crypto wallet, users have to securely store a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase, which can be prone to hacks or loss. With smart contract wallets, users would have more flexibility in managing their private keys and transactions, including the ability to create multiple wallet recovery options aside from storing a seed phrase. Additionally, account abstraction can also allow users to place desired security restrictions on wallet spending, including requesting special verification before certain transactions can be processed.Cardano is entering a new era of governance, the Age of Voltaire, which promises to revolutionize decentralized governance. As the final stage in Input Output\u2019s Cardano roadmap, the network is at a significant stage of its development.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "content": "The blockchain industry is evolving at a breakneck pace, with new networks and technologies emerging every day. One of the latest innovations that is grabbing headlines is Polygon's zkEVM mainnet. This network is designed to offer a faster and more cost-effective alternative to Ethereum's own mainnet, which has long been the backbone of the blockchain industry.Recently, Polygon's zkEVM mainnet achieved a major milestone when Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, executed the first transaction on the network. The transaction was carried out during a live-streamed event on Ethgloble's Youtube channel that marked a historic moment for the blockchain industry.Buterin's transaction included a special message that was encoded in hex code: \"A few million constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind.\" This message highlights the potential of Polygon's zkEVM network to overcome the scalability limitations that have plagued Ethereum's mainnet.\n\nButerin also set the transaction gas limit on the Ethereum network to an impressive 69,042, a subtle nod to two popular meme numbers. This cultural reference was praised by Sanket Shah, Polygon Labs' Head of Growth, who called Buterin \"a man of culture.\"The success of Polygon's zkEVM mainnet and Buterin's involvement in its launch have generated a lot of excitement in the blockchain industry. Many experts believe that this network has the potential to transform the way we think about blockchain scalability and performance.In conclusion, the launch of Polygon's zkEVM mainnet and Buterin's involvement in it is a significant development for the blockchain industry. This network promises to offer faster and more cost-effective transactions than Ethereum's mainnet, which could have a profound impact on the industry as a whole.

Cryptocurrencies have transformed the financial industry, enabled financial inclusion, and have the potential to revolutionize other industries through blockchain technology.Kagan's assertion that crypto mining is similar to high-frequency trading is misleading since their societal impacts are not comparable. Nvidia's decision to limit its graphics cards' mining capabilities risks stifling innovation and contributing to centralization.

Already under active development on the testnet, more than 55,000 smart contracts were deployed by over 18,000 developers in its first week, according to Coinbase.What is Layer 2?A \"second layer\" blockchain, Layer 2 reduces the load on the main chain and improves processing speed by writing some transaction history in off-chain or side-chain.Four Areas of InquiryBase's development will focus on designing decentralized stablecoins, building trust on-chain, designing a decentralized limit order board exchange, and building systems, protocols, and tools to securely store funds on the blockchain.Base aims to design inflation-tracking stablecoins called \"Flatcoins\" to stabilize the purchasing power of users and address economic uncertainties caused by traditional finance. Base is also looking for a team researching protocols for evaluating trust on the blockchain and how these systems can maintain user privacy and autonomy.In addition, Base will focus on designing a decentralized limit order board exchange that allows for professional traders and institutional investors to trade spot, limit orders, options, and perpetual. Lastly, Base is looking for developers who are building systems to securely store funds on the blockchain.Base's launch in February utilized Optimism's roll-up mechanism to operate. For the time being, Coinbase will use its experience to develop the network, with plans to gradually decentralize the network using ETH to pay for gas, and no plans to issue Base's own token.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more updates on this exciting development!",

To use the P2P feature, users may choose an ad or create a new one within the bot to quickly and securely purchase and sell USDT.Telegram's entry into the crypto market has been gaining momentum. In April 2022, the TON Foundation announced a feature for cryptocurrency payments using the TON token on the messaging app, even though the Open Network (TON) blockchain project's development was stopped in 2020 due to legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The introduction of stablecoins in messaging applications such as Telegram reduces the hurdles to entry into the crypto ecosystem for beginners. Stablecoins have many of the benefits of regular cryptocurrency assets but without the volatility associated with crypto investing. USDT is currently the world's largest stablecoin and the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).The move is expected to pave the way for widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies by making moving funds as simple as sending a text or a picture.

    "content": "If you're a crypto investor in Nigeria, buying cryptocurrencies just got a lot easier thanks to MetaMask. The major crypto wallet has partnered with crypto fintech MoonPay to enable direct crypto purchases via local bank transfers.\n\nThis integration is a game-changer for self-custody cryptocurrency purchases in Nigeria, significantly simplifying the process of buying crypto without using credit or debit cards. Before the partnership, the process of buying crypto was costly and time consuming, with a 90% decline rate for credit or debit card purchases.But now, with the new integration, users in Nigeria can access crypto faster and cheaper without sending assets from a centralized exchange. This is a significant development for the Nigerian crypto market, which has emerged as a major market for MetaMask, ranking third in mobile monthly active users.Despite the Central Bank of Nigeria banning banks from servicing crypto exchanges in February 2021, Nigeria is one of the world's top 20 ranked countries in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. In fact, some reports suggest that 35% of the Nigerian population aged 18 to 60 owned or traded cryptocurrencies in 2022.The new integration with MoonPay is estimated to reduce the decline rate for direct crypto purchases in Nigeria from 90% to 30%, according to MoonPay's chief product and strategy officer, Zeeshan Feroz. And, customers of all banks in Nigeria will have access to the service through Bank Transfers, which is a widely used payment method across Nigerian e-commerce businesses.In summary, MetaMask's partnership with MoonPay to enable direct crypto purchases in Nigeria is a significant development for the Nigerian crypto market. It's now easier and more affordable for Nigerian crypto investors to access cryptocurrencies, without relying on centralized exchanges.",

This airdrop is scheduled for March 23 and will send out 10 billion governance tokens via a token airdrop, which will allow holders to vote on code changes.Unfortunately, scammers have already set up hundreds of phishing websites and scams aimed at tricking crypto users into giving away their funds. Several fake Arbitrum websites and Twitter accounts have been reported by blockchain security companies, impersonating the official airdrop. These fake sites and accounts are designed to look official, and users are being asked to provide access to their funds, which would presumably result in scammers draining their wallets.\n\nThe community has been warned to stay vigilant and not interact with any suspicious links. According to the blockchain security company Redefine, several websites have already impersonated official Arbitrum airdrop websites. CertiK, another blockchain security firm, pointed to a fake Arbitrum Twitter account with the user name \"@arbitrum_launch\" advertising a token airdrop. They warned users not to interact with it.To avoid falling for scams, it's essential to be vigilant and stay informed about the latest phishing websites and scams. The official airdrop is set for March 23, and users should only interact with official Arbitrum websites and social media accounts.

    "publish_date": "March 18, 2023",
    "content": "In a recent announcement, Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has revealed that it is replacing BUSD stablecoin in its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) with TrueUSD (TUSD) and Tether (USDT). The SAFU fund was introduced in January 2022 as a $1 billion emergency insurance fund designed to protect Binance users in the event of a disaster. The fund's initial holdings included BNB, BUSD, and BTC.However, recent instructions from New York state officials to Paxos to cease minting fresh BUSD have led to Binance's decision to replace the unstable stablecoin with more reliable options. The move is aimed at ensuring that SAFU assets continue to protect customers, even as the BUSD market value gradually decreases. Binance has made it clear that it will continue to support the BUSD trading pair.The news has come as a blow to BUSD investors, as the stablecoin's market valuation has steadily declined from its peak of $15.5 billion in January 2023 to just $8.2 billion. Nevertheless, Binance has assured its users that all funds will continue to be stored at publicly verifiable locations, and no action is required on their part.In addition, Binance has also announced that it has added Dogecoin (DOGE) and 10 other cryptocurrencies to its improved proof-of-reserves system. This will allow customers to independently verify their DOGE and other cryptocurrency holdings. The exchange occasionally adds to the SAFU fund from its own resources to ensure that it is sufficiently financed.Overall, Binance's decision to replace BUSD in its SAFU fund with more reliable stablecoins is a move that is aimed at protecting its users' interests. The exchange's commitment to ensuring that all funds are stored at publicly verifiable locations and its continuous efforts to strengthen its proof-of-reserves system are positive signs for the cryptocurrency industry.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

    "publish_date": "March 18, 2023",
    "content": "Cryptocurrency wallets are responsible for holding users' private keys, which are crucial to accessing their funds. If someone gains access to a private key, they can transfer the funds to another account, effectively stealing them. This makes security a critical aspect of cryptocurrency wallets, and any vulnerability can have disastrous consequences.Recently, BitGo, a well-known cryptocurrency wallet, announced that it has fixed a serious flaw that could have exposed the private keys of its institutional and retail users. The vulnerability was discovered by the Fireblocks cryptography research team in December 2022 and reported to BitGo immediately. The BitGo Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) wallets were susceptible to the flaw, which could have compromised the private keys of the platform\u2019s users, exchanges, banks, and businesses.Dubbed BitGo Zero Proof Vulnerability, the flaw could have allowed an attacker to extract a user's private key in under a minute using just a few lines of JavaScript code. Fireblocks demonstrated the vulnerability by using a free BitGo mainnet account. The BitGo ECDSA TSS wallet protocol had a flaw that made it vulnerable to a trivial attack because it lacked a required zero-knowledge proof.After discovering the security flaw on December 10, BitGo immediately disabled the service and issued a patch in February 2023. The patch required all clients to upgrade to the most recent version by March 17. BitGo's swift action to fix the flaw in their system is commendable, and users can continue to use the platform with peace of mind.However, Fireblocks advised users to consider opening new wallets and transferring funds from ECDSA BitGo wallets before the fix was released. The vulnerability posed a risk to the private keys of users and businesses, and any unauthorized access to private keys could have resulted in significant financial losses.In conclusion, BitGo's quick response to the vulnerability and prompt fix is reassuring for users, but it is essential to remain vigilant in the cryptocurrency industry. The constant evolution of technology means that security risks are ever-present, and it is crucial to stay up-to-date with the latest security measures to prevent attacks and protect assets.Stay tuned to CoinTopper for more news!",

Florida-based commercial bank, Cogent Bank, has proposed a $100 million participation in loans to MakerDAO's RWA Master Participation Trust.\n\nThis proposal is part of MakerDAO's monthly governance cycle and aims to replicate the same terms and conditions that Pennsylvania-based Huntingdon Valley Bank (HVB) agreed upon when it entered into a collateral integration with MakerDAO in July 2022. This allowed HVB to borrow against its assets using DeFi.MakerDAO would use its trust arm to link Cogent Bank's capital to its Dai stablecoin under the same conditions. The trust entity would manage the partnership with the bank and ensure DAI minting and destruction from the vault.The DeFi protocol would gain exposure to the credit market in at least eight categories, including commercial real estate, industrial, life insurance, consumer, and public finance, with loans issued mostly on a fixed-rate basis.This collaboration would provide revenue sources for MakerDAO through fees associated with maintaining the vault, minting DAI, and yields.

    "content": "Canada to Tighten Rules for Crypto Exchanges Following SEC's InterventionAs the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intervenes in crypto businesses, Canada is taking steps to protect investors and regulate the industry. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is reportedly set to introduce new rules for crypto exchanges operating in the country. The move comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny from governments worldwide, including in Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, the crypto market is seeing a boost in Bitcoin (BTC) price, currently at its highest in eight months.Kraken's Staking Program: A Cautionary Tale for CanadaThe SEC's recent restriction on Kraken's staking program has raised concerns about the dangers of allowing U.S.-based crypto businesses to operate freely. Kraken faced charges for offering the staking service, which involved unregistered securities, resulting in the shutdown of the service and a $30 million fine as part of a settlement. As such, the new rules in Canada are aimed at discouraging the industry and protecting user investments with high taxes and tighter regulations.Protecting Investors and Replicating SEC's Strict RulesThe new rules are set to be expensive for crypto exchanges, potentially triggering businesses to migrate elsewhere from North America. However, the regulations aim to protect investors and replicate a similar environment to the U.S. following the SEC's proposal for stricter rules. The Canadian regulators are expected to provide more details shortly, but the plans have been in the works since 2022, with the FTX collapse acting as a catalyst for quicker implementation.Stay up-to-date with the latest news and updates by visiting cointopper.com.",

    "content": "Cardano Founder, Charles Hoskinson, Urges for a Structured and Fact-based Process for Decision MakingIn a series of tweets, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, expressed his frustration with the controversy surrounding Contingent Staking (CS) and called for a more informed and rational discussion on the matter.\n\nHoskinson criticized the polarization of opinions and misrepresentations of the basic concept of CS. He clarified that CS does not implement a KYC regime on Cardano, nor does it replace normal staking or remove private pools. He emphasized that a marketplace of stake pool operators (SPOs) would still exist, allowing people to delegate to their preferences, including normal stake pools.Hoskinson also pointed out that opponents of CS have not provided a solution for how actors such as governments, universities, regulated entities, not-for-profits, and others could run stake pools and stay in compliance with local regulations. He suggested that the opponents do not seem to understand the danger of an ISPO without entry conditions and contracts prior to getting customer funds. Additionally, he stated that opponents of CS want to remove all agencies of SPOs, claiming they are a public good.Hoskinson argued that SPOs compete against each other and charge fees for delegation and that they are an optional but valuable service provider, like mining pools in Bitcoin, to enhance the quality of the network and reduce reward variance. He questioned why discourse broke down like this with CS and emphasized that it's a moment that everyone should reflect upon.Hoskinson urged for a structured, transparent, and fact-based process to debate and converge to decisions if CIP 1694 passes and the MBO is a success. He warned that Cardano must not become a reflection of the greater divisions most western democracies are currently facing. Hoskinson believes that Cardano needs to be better for the sake of the seven years of hard work committed to these protocols and the millions of users who rely upon themStay tuned at CoinTopper.com for more news!",

Shytoshi Kusama, the creator of the popular meme currency SHIB, has recently dropped another enigmatic hint about the availability of Shibarium, leaving fans speculating.\n\nDespite refraining from disclosing a specific launch date, Kusama has hinted that the network's components would begin to emerge before May through one of the Shiba Inu community channels. This latest hint has sparked diverse interpretations among SHIB army enthusiasts, with some eagerly anticipating the release of Shibarium, while others express dissatisfaction with Kusama's ambiguous statements.However, Kusama has defended his decision, stating that Shibarium's release is not a simple switch and, therefore, cannot have an exact date. Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding the launch has divided investors, with some worried about the negative impact on SHIB's value.SHIB's value has been in steady decline since reaching its peak of $0.0000157 on February 4th, with a negative divergence in the daily RSI forming before the drop. Currently, SHIB's price hovers just above $0.0000120, a crucial region that has alternated between providing support and opposition over the last six months. The daily RSI indicates no clear trend, leaving investors uncertain about SHIB's future.Keep your eye on CoinTopper.com for more news!",

Following the successful launch of Shanghai on the public testnet Zhejiang (Zhejiang Province) on the 8th, the plan is to launch Shanghai on both Ethereum public testnets in the near future.\n\nAccording to core developer Tim Beiko, Sepolia is set to be integrated into Shanghai on February 28th and will be deployed on the Goerli testnet by mid-March. The Shanghai implementation on the mainnet is expected to take place around the end of March or April, but any bugs found during the process may cause adjustments to the schedule.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges and staking pools, among other staking service providers, will be able to test their ETH withdrawal capabilities for staking on these public testnets prior to going live.Impact on Ethereum StakingStaking is a process where rewards are earned by holding a certain amount of virtual currency for a specified period. By supporting the blockchain's operation, stakers receive compensation in the form of rewards.The Ethereum blockchain currently supports staking, but it is not yet possible to withdraw staked Ethereum or rewards. This withdrawal feature will be available in Shanghai, and Ethereum developers are continuously testing it.According to the official website, there is over 16.4 million ETH (equivalent to about 3.5 trillion yen) currently staked. The implementation of the withdrawal feature is expected to create some selling pressure in the short term, but also stimulate demand for staking.Data provider Staking Rewards shows that Ethereum's staking rate is around 14%, lower compared to competing blockchains like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) with over 60%.Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, a cryptocurrency index fund management firm, stated that \"the proportion of investors seeking ETH staking will explode if the indefinite lockup is lifted.\" The firm predicts a minimum increase of 50% in the staking rate of ETH in circulation by 2020.Investment bank JP Morgan highlights that 95% of Coinbase's retail investors may participate in Ethereum staking after the Shanghai upgrade. Coinbase's annual revenue is currently 225 million dollars (equivalent to 29.5 billion yen), and it is estimated to grow to 545 million dollars (70 billion yen) with the upgrade.\"Stay tuned to CoinTopper.com for more news!",

The Beijing Academy of Blockchain and Edge Computing (BABEC) will lead the new institution, known for developing the Chang\u2019an Chain or ChainMaker blockchain, which is supported by an ecosystem of 50 business corporations, many of which are state-owned. As of press time, the ChainMaker can handle up to 240 million transactions per second, a significant increase from its 100,000 TPS in 2021.Despite China's ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency, it has been promoting itself as a blockchain nation, claiming that 84% of all blockchain applications filed worldwide come from China. However, with a low approval rate of 19% for filed applications, the real numbers may not differ much. China has also embarked on a project for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), distributing millions of dollars worth of e-CNY to boost its adoption.

The exfiltration of assets took place last year, but the victim only made the announcement on his blog on February 6th. This has sparked a debate and raised questions about Trust Wallet's credibility.\n\nInvestigations have revealed that the fraud was likely carried out by an Italian criminal group using a method known as \"social engineering\". This method takes advantage of human weaknesses and mistakes to steal important information, such as passwords for accessing software.According to Trust Wallet, the Italian gang posed as Web3 investors and approached individuals involved in various cryptocurrency projects with the intention of holding face-to-face meetings to explain and negotiate. Ahad Shams, co-founder of Webaverse, who was also a victim of the scam, wrote on his blog that he and the scammers held a meeting in Rome in November 2010.Trust Wallet explained that the culprit convinced the victim to transfer funds from a multi-sig wallet to a single wallet by giving a fake reason and providing a PDF of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and KYC information. After the transfer, the fraudster requested the victim to show proof of funds and took a photo of the wallet balance. This ultimately led to the loss of the virtual currency.The wallet provider believes that the PDF of the NDA was infected with malware, which allowed the criminal to access the private key of the hot wallet stored on the device. Trust Wallet also noted that hot wallets on various devices, including iPhones, Androids, and Macs, have been affected, not just those of its users, but multiple wallet providers as well.Trust Wallet has undergone a security audit and penetration test by internal and external auditors, but the company is still warning users to be cautious and not to click on links or open files sent to their phones or prompted for download. According to blockchain data site Etherscan, $4 million in USDC was leaked in a transaction on November 26, with the stolen funds split between six addresses, with one address holding 83% of the stolen assets.Other victims of the Italian criminal group had not only used hot wallets, but also cold wallets that were offline, according to Trust Wallet. Shams reported the theft to the police in Rome and the FBI shortly after the incident was discovered last November. Webaverse has a runway of 12 to 16 months.Trust wallet also provided the guide. be aware of scammers and whatever you are doing with your funds, and online activities do it carefully.\u00a0\n\nstay tuned at CoinTopper.com for more news!",

Armstrong believes that such a move would be detrimental to the U.S. and to the growth of new technologies in the country.\n\nStaking is a crucial innovation in the world of cryptocurrency that allows users to participate directly in running open crypto networks. It offers several benefits, including improved scalability, increased security, and reduced carbon footprints. Armstrong believes that the U.S. needs to foster new technologies, not stifle its growth through unclear rules and regulations.When it comes to financial services and web3, Armstrong argues that it is a matter of national security that these capabilities are developed in the U.S. He believes that regulation through enforcement does not work and can drive companies offshore, as was the case with FTX.The Coinbase CEO is hopeful that the SEC and the crypto industry can work together to create clear rules and regulations that protect consumers while preserving innovation and national security interests in the U.S. He believes that it is possible to come up with sensible solutions that balance these interests.In conclusion, Armstrong's comments reflect the growing concerns among the crypto industry about the role of regulations in shaping the future of the industry.

Infura, developed by Consensys, has been criticized for the potential risk of personal information being leaked if the user's wallet address and IP address stored on the network are compromised.In response to these concerns, Metamask now makes it easier to change RPCs and includes a warning in the settings screen that any RPC selected will receive the user's IP address and Ethereum wallet information. Despite this, the new feature is seen as positive by some as it offers an alternative to Consensys' high-risk data collection policy.The phishing detection toggle is a new addition to Metamask's security and privacy settings and helps protect users from the cybercrime of phishing, where attackers deceive users by directing them to fake websites and stealing personal information and authentication information.

Additionally, the average daily transactions rose by a staggering 85% from the previous quarter, reaching a high of 2,881,20.This growth in daily transactions is a promising sign for the future of the Avalanche network and its native cryptocurrency, AVAX. The total transactions per second on the network also nearly doubled from 18 in the third quarter to 33 in the fourth quarter.While the growth in daily transactions is positive, the report also showed some areas for improvement.

According to his analysis, the bottom in the price of BTC has formed a rare \u201cdouble-walled fulcrum pattern\u201d. This pattern is not widely recognized in the traditional financial market, and has been introduced by Brandt himself.\n\nThe veteran trader has set a 2X target for the cryptocurrency, with a mid-$25,000 prediction. This latest analysis has generated a lot of interest among traders and investors, given Brandt's extensive experience in the financial market and previous insights on Bitcoin. However, there have been skeptics who have criticized Brandt's recent chart pattern, calling it an example of hindsight bias.Despite these criticisms, the cryptocurrency market is off to a strong start in 2023, with Bitcoin leading the charge with a 40% increase. This rebound is part of a larger trend in increased risk appetite, but there are concerns about the economy and warnings from some parts of the global market that may impact its longevity. Despite these uncertainties, momentum continues, with one strategist targeting $25,000 for Bitcoin and it being on track for its best month since December 2020. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech may also impact market expectations.In conclusion, Peter Brandt's latest analysis of the Bitcoin market is likely to be closely followed by those in the industry. With his extensive experience and previous insights, traders and investors will be keeping a close eye on his predictions.

    "content": "As per the latest reports, many crypto geeks believe that Cardano is gearing up for the launch of its own stablecoin. COTI officially announced that Cardano would launch their stablecoin DJED next week.\n\nCOTI is behind the development of the DJED stablecoin. Bitrue has announced that they will list $DJED and $SHEN on their exchange platform.\n\nDJED is pegged by ADA and its reserve coin Shen. Let's see, How the process worksTo mint the DJED, a user needs to send ADA in the smart contract, then the contract will send Djed back to the user.The price of Djed will aspire to be $1. The basecoin which is the coin that Djed is backed by is $ADA. Let\u2019s assume $ADA is worth $2, so in order to mint 1 Djed, the user will need to send 0.5 $ADA to the contract.If the user wants to get back the ADA then the user sends the DJED to the smart contract and the smart contract burns that DJED and will send back the ADA.Shen Reserve Coin is an integral part of the Djed ecosystem, providing stability and liquidity to ensure price stability for its stablecoin users. It works by minting $Shen tokens in order to maintain a sufficient peg ratio. When the Reserve Ratio falls below 400%, holders of Shen will not be able to burn their coins for ADA, as this would prioritize those who hold stablecoins over those holding Shen. Conversely, when the reserve ratio reaches 800%, no new purchases of $Shen are allowed in order to avoid excessive risk or rewards from trading activity. By trading $Shen on exchanges, users can help maintain a healthy peg ratio and receive incentives from transaction fees collected by the underlying stablecoin's smart contract pool which is shared among all participants that contribute towards maintaining price stability through their participation with Shen Reserve Coin.DJED stablecoin is very different from any other algorithmic stablecoin in the way, it\u2019s built.

The Finance Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman, recently announced that the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with G20 countries. However, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. The government has also recently revealed that it is launching a crypto awareness campaign.On the other hand, India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that \"cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value\" and warned that it will undermine the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy. He even expects crypto to cause the next financial crisis if it is not banned.It is clear that there are differing opinions about the regulation and future of cryptocurrency in India. It will be interesting to see how the government navigates this issue and how it ultimately chooses to regulate the use of digital currencies in the country.",

In a statement, Winklevoss said that the bankruptcy was \"a crucial step towards\" recovering assets for Gemini Earn users.\n\nThe bankruptcy of Genesis highlights the volatility of the crypto industry and the need for increased transparency and accountability to protect investors.

    "content": "An NFT influencer known as \"NFT God\" has reported losing a significant portion of their net worth in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrency due to a malware attack through a sponsored Google Ad. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of being cautious when clicking on sponsored ads and the need for improved security measures to protect against crypto-stealing malware.\n\nAccording to the influencer, they were searching for OBS, an open-source video streaming software, on Google's search engine and clicked on a sponsored ad that they believed was for the same thing. However, it was later discovered that malware was also downloaded from the ad, which led to the compromise of their crypto wallet and multiple online accounts.\n\nThe influencer believes that the \"critical mistake\" that allowed the wallet hack was setting up their hardware wallet as a hot wallet, by entering its seed phrase \"in a way that no longer kept it cold,\" or offline, which allowed the hackers to gain control of their crypto and NFTs.This is not the first time that the crypto community has dealt with crypto-stealing malware in Google Ads. A recent report from cybersecurity firm Cyble warned of an information-stealing malware called \"Rhadamanthys Stealer\" spreading through Google Ads on \"highly convincing phishing webpage[s].\" In October, Binance CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao also warned that Google search results were promoting crypto phishing and scamming websites.Google has stated that it \"actively works with trusted advertisers and partners to help prevent malware in ads\" and uses \"proprietary technology and malware detection tools\" to regularly scan Google Ads. However, it is important for individuals to also take responsibility for their own security measures, such as being cautious when clicking on sponsored ads, and securing their digital assets properly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

    "content": "Bitcoin Bull Run Ahead: Peter Brandt Predicts Inverted Head and Shoulders PatternVeteran trader and analyst, Peter Brandt, has shared a bullish outlook on Bitcoin in a recent tweet, stating that the cryptocurrency is forming an inverted head and shoulders chart pattern on higher time frames. Brandt cautions that no one can predict with certainty what the market will do, but his analysis suggests that Bitcoin is on the cusp of a major rally.\n\nAccording to Brandt, the short-term outlook for Bitcoin is a rally to around $25,000 before a potential pullback to retest the neckline at around $18,387.5. In the long term, the veteran trader predicts that the asset will rally as high as $50,000 in 2023 and over $100,000 in 2024 after a drop below $34,000.Brandt's analysis implies that the bottom of this cycle has already been reached and we will not see a drop to $13,000, which was the last clear bottom prediction by the analyst. This bullish outlook is in line with the overall sentiment in the crypto market, as many experts believe that the current market conditions are favorable for a price rally.It's worth noting that these predictions are based on technical analysis, which is subject to interpretation and can be affected by various factors. Therefore, it's important to do your own research and not rely only on any one analyst's predictions.Overall, Brandt's analysis is a positive sign for those who are bullish on Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole. With a potential inverted head and shoulders pattern forming, it's an exciting time for investors and traders to keep an eye on the cryptocurrency's price action.",

    "content": "StarkWare, a company that develops scaling solutions for Ethereum (ETH), has released a new full node client called \"Papyrus\" for its ZK rollup solution called \"StarkNet\" on January 11th. Papyrus is built using the programming language \"Rust\" and is open-sourced under the Apache license. The company claims that Papyrus will help pave the way for mass use of StarkNet.StarkNet uses ZK Rollup technology, which aggregates multiple transactions processed off-chain into a single cryptographic certificate and stores it on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers higher fraud resistance and faster transaction processing times compared to other rollup solutions.\n\nPapyrus is the third type of StarkNet full node client and it is expected to improve network decentralization and redundancy. The diversification of clients can reduce the impact of a denial of service attack (DoS). StarkNet was launched on the Ethereum mainnet in November 2021 but is still in the alpha stage.StarkNet is currently in the second step of its three-step roadmap which includes: establishing usability, improving performance, and decentralization. Papyrus is expected to improve the processing performance of the \"sequencer,\" which is responsible for generating blocks on StarkNet. It will also be the basis for providing the storage layer for the upcoming \"StarkNet Sequencer\" feature.The Papyrus team is working with the teams behind the other two StarkNet node clients, Pathfinder and Juno, to form the foundation for a peer-to-peer (P2P) layer for StarkNet. This will greatly improve the network synchronization time and lead to a more decentralized network. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has stated that he expects many rollup projects to become more decentralized by the end of 2023 and move to \"stage 1 (limited training wheels),\" which reduces the level of trust required in rollup developers and increases the safety of using L2.",

    "content": "WazirX, a popular cryptocurrency exchange based in India, recently published proof of reserves as a means of ensuring transparency and building trust with its users.Proof of reserves is a mechanism used by cryptocurrency exchanges to demonstrate that they hold the amount of digital assets that they claim to hold. This is important because, without proof of reserves, an exchange could potentially be running a fractional reserve system, meaning that they are only holding a fraction of the assets they claim to hold, and using the rest for other purposes such as trading or lending. By publishing proof of reserves, WazirX is showing its users that it is fully solvent and able to meet all of its withdrawal requests.\n\nWazirX's proof of reserves was audited by a leading accounting firm and the results were published on the exchange's website. The audit included a review of WazirX's cryptocurrency holdings, as well as its cash holdings, and verified that the exchange holds more assets than it owes to its customers.This move by WazirX is a step towards greater transparency in the cryptocurrency space. As the use of cryptocurrency becomes more widespread, it is important for exchanges to build trust with their users, and publishing proof of reserves is one way to do this. Additionally, this move also helps the crypto exchange to comply with some regulatory requirements.In conclusion, WazirX's publishing of proof of reserves is a positive step towards ensuring transparency and building trust with its users. It is a clear demonstration of the exchange's commitment to maintaining the safety and security of its customers' assets. With this step, it sets an example for other cryptocurrency exchanges to follow. this is not investment advice. before investing anywhere, do your own research.\u00a0",

One such project is Tornado Cash, a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer that has been providing users with privacy-protecting services since 2019. Unfortunately for its users, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) recently sanctioned it in August 2022 due to allegations that it had facilitated money laundering involving billions of dollars worth of crypto assets - including $455m stolen by North Korea's Lazarus Group.\n\nSince then, Tornado Cash has experienced a 68% drop in total inflows according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis - likely due to OFAC's sanctions acting as more than just an inconvenience but rather as a deterrent from using the platform altogether. While OFAC was able to shut down Tornado Cash\u2019s front-end website, its smart contracts are still running indefinitely which means anyone can theoretically still use this service at any time if they choose to despite potential repercussions from doing so.This situation serves as yet another reminder about how important security is when utilizing digital currencies or any other online service for financial transactions \u2013 especially when dealing with large amounts like those allegedly laundered through Tornado Cash by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group!

In a speech given at Paris on January 5th, he argued that France should not wait\u00a0for impending EU crypto rules before requiring local Digital Asset Service Providers (DASPs) to obtain licenses.At present time Financial Markets Authority (AMF) requires \"registration\" from firms offering crypto trading and custody services but having a DASP license is voluntary. Out of 60 registered companies with AMF only none holds a DASP license yet according to Bloomberg.\u00a0It's clear that Governor Villeroy de Galhau wants to bring more transparency and accountability within this sector as well as provide better protection against fraudulent activities like money laundering etc., so it will be interesting to see what new regulations are going be put forward by French government over coming weeks and months ahead.",

Despite this, there was still a significant amount of investment, but the current economic, monetary, and cryptoasset environment suggests that 2023 may be a challenging year for all involved. Tightening financial conditions often lead to declining valuations and stricter demands from investors, creating a more difficult fundraising environment for entrepreneurs. In order to succeed in 2023, startups will need to focus on their fundamentals, control operational expenses, and drive revenue.\n\nWeb3 related startups, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), the metaverse, and blockchain-related gaming, dominated the deal count in Q4 2022, comprising over 30% of deals. It remains to be seen if this trend will continue into 2023.\n\nThe United States remains the dominant player in the crypto startup ecosystem. Given the ongoing importance of the US in these markets and its leading position, it is crucial for US policymakers to clarify and codify rules and regulations for the emerging space. Other jurisdictions have already taken steps in this direction.",

Fortunately, this issue has now been fixed thanks to Uniswap\u2019s bug bounty program which was launched late 2022. As part of this program, Dedaub was awarded a bounty of $40,000 for flagging the vulnerability which had medium severity with high impact and low likelihood according to Uniswap.\n\nBug bounties are becoming increasingly popular as an effective way to ensure safety and security within software or systems used by cryptocurrency firms or blockchain companies. Companies such as Immunefi have facilitated over $65 million worth of bug bounties between ethical hackers and Web3 firms just last year alone showing how beneficial these programs can be when it comes to protecting users from potential cyber threats.Not only do these programs provide financial incentives for those who report vulnerabilities but they also help create trust between developers/users while ensuring that any issues are addressed immediately before they become serious problems down the line. In short; utilizing bug bounties is one way we can continue developing secure technology within our industry while simultaneously rewarding those who go out their way to protect us all from harm",

This statement has sparked a lot of debate among investors and financial experts alike.\n\nThe question on everyone\u2019s mind is: how many people are still involved in the crypto market after years of ups and downs? According to recent estimates, millions of users across the world are currently invested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Ripple (XRP). Despite its volatility, cryptos have become an attractive asset class due to their potential for high returns over short periods.However, there is no denying that investing in digital currencies can be risky business. With prices fluctuating rapidly on a daily basis \u2013 sometimes even within minutes \u2013 it can be difficult to make accurate predictions about future price movements or determine when you should enter/exit trades. That said, some analysts believe that this volatility could actually work out favorably if one knows what they\u2019re doing; they argue that savvy traders may use these fluctuations as opportunities for quick profits by buying low and selling high at just the right times.It remains unclear whether or not Mr. Cramer's prediction will come true; only time will tell if 2023 proves itself another tough year for those who invest in cryptocurrencies. In any case though, regardless of where prices go from here, it appears clear from current figures alone that millions around the globe remain interested enough so far - which suggests more involvement than ever before - with new investors joining every day.",

    "content": "Today marks the 14th anniversary of Bitcoin, a revolutionary digital currency that has changed the way we think about money and financial transactions. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has become an increasingly popular form of payment for goods and services around the world. To celebrate this milestone, let\u2019s take a look at how it all began and what lies ahead for this groundbreaking technology.Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 as an open-source software project with no central authority or middlemen involved in its operations. The idea behind it was to create a decentralized system where users could transfer funds without having to go through banks or other traditional financial institutions. This meant that users had full control over their finances without any third-party interference \u2013 something many people found appealing due to increasing distrust towards banks after the global economic crisis of 2008-2009.Since then, Bitcoin has grown exponentially both in terms of user adoption and value appreciation; from being worth just fractions of cents when it first launched up until now trading at thousands per coin - making some early adopters millionaires along the way! It is estimated that today there are more than 10 million active bitcoin wallets worldwide holding nearly $200 billion worth combined - proof enough that cryptocurrency is here to stay!As we move forward into 2023 with new technologies such as blockchain gaining traction across various industries including finance & banking, healthcare supply chain management, etc., one can only assume what kind of potential opportunities await us down on road. With governments slowly starting to recognize cryptocurrencies like BTC as legal tender & major companies investing heavily in research & development-related projects, the future definitely looks bright! We may even see mass adoption within the next few years which will allow everyone access to these amazing benefits associated with crypto assets.All things considered, it's safe to say bitcoin made great strides since its inception 14 years ago showing immense promise to continue doing so well beyond the foreseeable future!",

    "content": "As Hong Kong prepares to implement new legislation regulating the trading of virtual assets, brokers in the region are rushing to obtain approval from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The new regulations, which are set to take effect in November, will require brokers to register with the SFC and meet certain requirements before they can engage in virtual asset trading.According to industry sources, a number of Hong Kong brokers have already submitted their applications for SFC approval and are waiting for a response. These brokers are eager to get ahead of the curve and ensure that they are compliant with the new regulations before they come into effect.The SFC has not yet revealed how many brokers have applied for approval, but it is expected that the number will increase significantly in the coming weeks. The regulator has indicated that it will be working closely with brokers to ensure that they meet the necessary standards and are able to operate in a safe and transparent manner.The new virtual asset trading regulations are seen as a major step forward for the industry in Hong Kong, as they will provide greater protection for investors and help to foster greater confidence in the market. While there may be some initial disruption as brokers adjust to the new rules, the long-term benefits are expected to far outweigh any short-term challenges.",

    "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has achieved a major milestone on his roadmap diagram with the successful rollout of EIP-4844. This new development marks an important step towards achieving scalability and increased performance for Ethereum.Known as \u201cbasic rollup scaling\u201d, this technology allows developers to create smart contracts that are more efficient and secure than ever before. By taking off some of its training wheels (at least at stages 0 through 2), it is now possible to scale up transactions while still providing robust security measures. This will enable faster transaction times while also reducing costs associated with running dApps on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain network.The implementation of basic rollups is just one part of Vitalik's overall plan for improving scalability and performance within the ecosystem - something he has been working hard on since launching his original roadmap. With this latest breakthrough, we can expect further developments from Vitalik soon that will bring even greater improvements to how applications run on top of Ethereum's blockchain platform .\n\nOverall , these advancements show us how far we have come from when Vitalik first began developing his vision for a decentralized future . We look forward to seeing what other milestones he reaches as he continues down his path towards building a better world powered by distributed ledger technologies like those found in cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin or Etheruem itself!",

Fortunately, Ripple, the company behind the world's third-largest cryptocurrency XRP now has a solution.Ripple recently announced xRapid, which allows both businesses and individuals to take advantage of instant transfers and low charges using XRP.Ripple has been making news and turning heads with its RippleNet services, which marks its presence in over 40 countries and has been growing at around 2 new customers per week. The company has been very careful about how to make the process easy and completely legal and has a clear roadmap on how to simplify the day to day transactions without any hiccups.Ripple Labs will offer 3 services with their RippleNet platform, namely, xVia, xCurrent, and xRapid. Instead of focusing on all the features individually, the company has opted to integrate them tightly with RippleNet as the core technology.There are some major players from the banking sector who have tied up with Ripple, some of them being Western Union, MercuryFX, and Cualix. Though the test runs done by Western Union indicated that xRapid didn't really save them any time, we might mention that the transactions were done between Mexico and the United States. As for the other two partners mentioned, Cualix and MercuryFX saw a notable decrease in the time and money required to complete the transfer.Although the announcement of xRapid did not surge in the price of XRP, it will be exciting to see where this technology goes once more banks and institutions sign up for RippleNet.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

XRP has been able to surpass Ethereum, albeit for a while, to become the worlds second most valuable cryptocurrency.In a conference in San Francisco last week, the CEO of Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, Brad Garlinghouse told the public about how XRP has proven itself to be faster and cheaper than the highly popular Bitcoin. It's noteworthy that the conference was held with Bill Clinton as its keynote speaker.Surprisingly, this isn't the first time that a CEO has used such an event to create buzz around their product to lure customers to invest in altcoins, Dogecoin and Cardano having used similar advertising techniques.In the same conference, Ripple also announced their new product, xRapid, which can now use the XRP tokens allowing them to complete international payments in just a few minutes making it faster than Bitcoin since it is built on the same network as Ethereum.xRapid, along with XRP, is clearly a cryptocurrency for banks and has been already accepted by various banks as a mode of payment. The fact whether it will be bigger and more successful than Bitcoin doesn't seem to matter at all to the crypto community who have embraced it with open arms.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

As of now, the application has not faced any complaints of any sort, but MetaMask seems to believe that it looks \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d, which is maybe why they have blacklisted 333ETH as an active scam.So far over the last month, the dApp has transacted ETH of worth over $3 million from its smart contract address and has 1700 live users. While there seems to be nothing out of place as the application is working the way it was promised to, MetaMask seems to have its own doubts.MetaMask is now warning its users with the following message when they try to visit 333ETH:\u201cMetaMask believes this domain could currently compromise your security and has prevented you from interacting with it. This is because the site tested positive on the Ethereum Phishing Detector. This includes outright malicious websites and legitimate websites that have been compromised by a malicious actor. You can turn MetaMask off to interact with this site, but it is advised not to.\u201dThough it is not uncommon for some dApps to turn out to be really scams of some sort, this particular move is viewed as a kind of \u201cpersonal attack\u201d on 333ETH by many.As one Twitter user @ChrisBlec had to say,\u201cVery interesting that @metamask_io has blocked the #1 most-trafficked dapp because it simply doesn\u2019t like it. From what I can tell, 333eth is an ownerless, autonomous, unstoppable smart contract with transparent code. Is it a good idea to use? No. Should bad ideas be blocked? NO.\u201dAs to getting a definitive answer on whether this application is one with malicious intents, we can only wait.Share your views on this action by MetaMask in the comments below!

    "content": "In yet another instance of established, long-standing firms investing in blockchain based assets and services, titans such as Goldman Sachs and Google are now backing up Veem, a startup that incorporates blockchain technology to make money transfers more convenient.The firm led by Marwan Forzely (who formerly owned eBillme, which he sold to Western Union) uses three methods to ease transactions: Treasury, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and blockchain. The first one is supposed to be used to move money between bank accounts that are in control of the company, whereas SWIFT refers to the traditional mode of payments as employed in banks. The third mode, the one that has attracted the most interest, is using blockchain to perform fund transfer quicker and easier.To use Veem, one needn\u2019t have to possess bitcoins, as they make use of an algorithm which \u201chelps in routing transactions along the most secured payment rails with reliance on cryptocurrency\u201d. Veem stands on a whopping $69.3 million worth of investment pitched in by various companies, which find their built-in \u2018stickiness\u2019 model promising.The high-profile investors include Silicon Valley Bank, Goldman Sachs, Google Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Pantera Capital, and Trend Forward. With all that support, it is no wonder that Veem has seen a 13000% increase in customer base over the last three years.In the words of Google Ventures\u2019 general partner, Karim Faris, \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to create a stand-alone company and in the process make a financial return on a good exit or an IPO down the line.\u201d Faris has also been included in Veem\u2019s board as a non-voting member.Last year, Veem also announced the launch of its API. This is said to pave way to the further expansion of the firm to more countries and complement its multi-track approach to aiding money transactions.Forzely had said during the announcement that,\u201cWe\u2019re all accustomed to experiences where payment and commerce easily work together. Veem is bringing that integrated experience to businesses with our API.\u201dFor more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

    "publish_date": "September 27, 2018",
    "content": "Bitcoin wallet provider BTC.com is all set to adopt a new payment protocol that is extremely customer-friendly as compared to its predecessors.The protocol, known as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 70 (BIP70) eases user payment experience by allowing them to make transactions to normal human-readable addresses, as opposed to the bitcoin addresses that other protocols use. The latter, being very long, cumbersome and confusing to read, has been a major cause of erroneous payments in cryptocurrency.BitPay, after employing BIP70 as its invoicing standard earlier this year, found that errors in transactions dropped from nearly 10% in June 2017 to a mere 0.27% in the recent times, says the firm.BTC.com\u2019s VP of business operations, Alejandro de la Torre expressed to CCN that\u201cWhen a merchant uses BitPay, in order for their customers to pay using bitcoin or bitcoin cash, they must use a BIP 70 compatible wallet to complete the transaction. BitPay is one of the biggest providers of crypto-merchant services, and we believe in offering the best payment experience for our users that also supports onboarding merchants.\u201dHowever, BIP70 has not just seen all positive feedback. Other wallet providers such as Samourai Wallet hold the view that the protocol may lead to an increased chance of AML/KYC surveillance and make bitcoin transactions more susceptible to security bugs in OpenSSL. These critics serve as faithful proponents of the universally supported BIP21.In any case, BTC.com seems firm in their move to adopt BIP70 and has recently even assured that they have \u201ctaken the time to carefully evaluate all security and privacy concerns\u201d associated with this decision.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

The decision was announced by the exchange on its Twitter handle as follows:\u201cWhile one of our top customer requests has been to add support for many new digital assets, we have been determining how to do this in a compliant and secure way that maintains the standards our customers have come to expect.\u201dFurther, they added that\u00a0\u201cCoinbase was founded to give people around the world access to a more open financial system. Towards this end, we\u2019ve always taken a deliberate approach to adding support for new assets to the platform\u201d, acknowledging the fact that they have been, and still strive to be a rather \u201ccautious\u201d crypto trading exchange when compared to other major players in the industry.It is expected that while choosing their future altcoin listings, the firm would look for those that are decentralized to a reasonable extent and are not likely to be labeled as security.Though not all of Coinbase\u2019s decisions have sat well with the majority, it is a widely accepted fact that they do cause major shifts and trends in the market.

    "content": "Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs as they are commonly known, play a key role in stock markets around the world. But two prominent cryptocurrency stakeholders feel that ETFs may not make an entrance in the domain by the end of the year, as detailed on the popular cryptocurrency show CryptoTrader.An ETF, as described by Investopedia, is a \u201cmarketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund\u201d. For example, the ownership of a resource such as bonds or gold bars can be divided into shares and traded in a way similar to stocks by those who possess them.The host of CryptoTrader, Ran NeuNer, chose to take opinions from Maja Vujinovic, the CEO of O Group and Dave Chapman from the Asian counter trading firm OSL. The former put forth that since ETFs do not necessarily bring liquidity, the crypto industry does not need them. She also added that they aren\u2019t the only way by which institutional investors can be attracted to put their money in cryptocurrency.When asked if ETFs will be approved to step into the crypto domain by the end of the year, she replied in the negative, further going on that,\u201cSEC will probably check with their counterparts somewhere else that it needs to go through\u2026 Various different organizations before an approval. I don\u2019t see that happening by end of this year. Simple fact of human lack of ability. We are such linear learners and this technology is exponential, I think there\u2019s a completeness balance here.\u201dFrom Chapman\u2019s point of view, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) does not see quality exchanges in the crypto space, which is why they have rejected ETF proposals so far.Two popular ETFs that were proposed this year, Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF and the VanEck Solid X Bitcoin ETF barely saw any success as the former was rejected by the SEC whereas the latter sits waiting list.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

For example, buying one USD/BTC futures contract will result in daily delivery of one Bitcoin into the customer\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nThis move comes amidst mixed views from industry stakeholders, some of whom believe that bitcoin ETFs may not be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even by the end of this year.Even so, others feel that the security in storing digital assets (which is an advantage when it comes to the crypto sector) may push SEC into giving its nod to bitcoin ETFs.Brian Kelly of CNBC expressed on the matter, stating:\u201cThis is huge news. I think the market is completely underappreciated. So let us talk about why [Bakkt] is the biggest news of the year for Bitcoin.It paves the way for a Bitcoin ETF. Last week I stood here and said you know what, I don\u2019t think the Bitcoin ETF will get approved. And guess what? The Winklevoss ETF got rejected. Why?Because there was not a US regulated exchange and there wasn\u2019t US regulated custody.\u201dBakkt aims to provide a seamless worldwide forum for stakeholders to invest and trade in digital assets in a simple manner.

Legislators should be embracing emerging technologies and providing a clear regulatory system that allows them to flourish in the United States.\u201dThe bills aim to reduce regulations on crypto-miners and blockchain-based companies (that do not deal with user crypto assets) so that they can operate with lesser restrictions upon them while enjoying a \u201csimple legal environment\u201d. This comes in the light of the recent incident where US administrators urged the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to formulate a clear tax framework for those holding crypto assets in their possession so that these laws do not pose as a hindrance to the growing blockchain industry.Emmer has also been appointed the co-chairman of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, which looks to promote interaction between blockchain stakeholders and US legislators so as to derive meaningful insights on pushing the technology forward.The active participation and support of governmental organizations in the blockchain industry are sure to be a good news for the community.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

He stated:\u201cIn 2016 what we did was we piloted with 12 banks. These 12 banks were based across regions across the globe and they did not have prefunded relationships with each other. and what we did was we gave these banks some XRP and asked them to settle within themselves and it worked beautifully.\u201dSupporting the above statement, a tweet was made by Steven Diep on September 18:\n\nAt that time, XRP fitted well in cross-border payment usecase, however, a system was required for allowing the banks to utilize it due to the regulatory issues back then. Such issues were faced by the banks as per Sarbhai. He remarked:\"[They said] we would love to adopt it but we cannot, because there are capital requirements and regulatory uncertainty. So they said that its volatile, [and that] there are no set of regulations, so we cannot hold those assets in our books.\u201dThis led the team of Ripple to come up with an evolved product - xRapid. For driving its mass adoption, Ripple started to partner up with payment providers who showed interest in using xRapid. Sarbhai said:\u201cThat works because they don\u2019t have to hold the digital asset on their books but using the piece of software called xRapid they can actually connect to a digital asset exchange, convert fiat to XRP at that time and XRP to fiat in real time on the other end and that actually happens in 3 seconds so there\u2019s no case of volatility risk as well.\u201dThese were the revelations made by Sarbhai.

    "content": "On September 1, 2018, an official announcement was made by Bitcoin Gold (BTG) that, the cryptocurrency is set to be delisted from Seattle-based crypto exchange Bittrex. This comes because of a refusal to pay 12,372 BTG to Bittrex for remaining listed on the exchange.Bitcoin Gold explained the reason behind why Bittrex chose to delist the cryptocurrency through a tweet posted on their official Twitter account. The firm disclosed that its decision to refuse the payment of 12,372 BTG, approximately $262,907, provoked the exchange platform to discard the pairings of BTC-BTG, ETH-BTG, and USDT-BTG, with effect from September 14, 2018.\n\nMoreover, bitcoin gold also remarked that being delisted from Bittrex won't affect the BTG ecosystem \"substantially.\"The company expressed that lately, Bittrex has not been the top liquidity provider as compared with the major crypto exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, and Bithumb, among others.The background behind this is, Bittrex faced a malicious double-spend attack back in May 2018 by NiceHash using the 51 percent hack process. The attack is said to be the greatest ever BTG double-spend attacks that put Bittrex under intense distress and investigation.As a result, Bittrex requested bitcoin gold team to pay a sum of 12,372 BTG to compensate for the attack happened. Bittrex even lowered the amount to 6,000 BTG, but bitcoin gold team declined to pay the sum, saying that the attack had nothing to do with their blockchain or code. The team clarified that it's not their responsibility for any rupture of security inside the exchange.The BTG team also added that the amount of 6000 BTG probably won't make any difference to the profitable exchange, however, it's quite a significant amount for a non-profit organization as it would mean liquidating the said amount from their revenue fund.Currently, at the press time, bitcoin gold is trading at $21.61 per token, with an aggregate market top of around $365 million.Let's see what Bittrex have to say in reaction to BTG's official post.\u00a0For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

    "content": "The South Korean province of Gyeongsangbuk has turned into an unlikely area for the latest government-approved crypto experiment, with the news that it intends to set up its own cryptocurrency.This move makes a symbolic impact after South Korea considered putting a China-style ban on crypto trading around nine months back.Gyeongbuk CoinAs reported by Joongang Daily, the new cryptocurrency, called Gyeongbuk Coin is expected to replace the gift vouchers at vendors everywhere throughout the area, which incorporates South Korea's fourth-biggest city Daegu. The existing payment system will be replaced in favor of the new coin, which will be available for purchase through an exchange.The area expects to issue 100 billion won (generally $100 million) worth of Gyeongbuk Coin each year, which precisely matches that of the past provincial payment system, known as 'Hometown Love Gift Cards'.The plan is for a group of engineers and benchmarkers to make an exchange for the residents of Gyeongbuk-do and surrounding territories to buy the new coin with their won. Local businessmen will then start to accept Gyeongbuk Coin in exchange for goods and services.Giving his thoughts on the new cryptocurrency, Sunghyun Chung, head of the science and technology policy department of Gyeongsangbuk-do, stated:\u201cThere are still many problems to be solved by notifying merchants of the way they use coins, creating separate programs, and issuing coins. Cryptocurrencies, however, are a core technology to be accepted.\u201dGiving an example of technologies worthy of borrowing from Zug, a member of Gyeongsangbuk's benchmarking group stated:\u201cI think we can utilize the information we borrowed from Zug City to make blockchain-based Gyeongbuk provincial government ID cards for 5,000 employees.\u201dIn adaptability of the new system, blockchain startup Orbs has signed an agreement with Gyeongsangbuk-do to offer support for their local cryptocurrency project.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

    "publish_date": "August 31, 2018",
    "content": "Google's involvement has certainly made a huge impact in the world of Blockchain.The London School of Economics (LSE) have published a report that explores why it's a huge news that Google is now striking on to blockchain \u2013 after a declaration that proposes the Google Cloud is to be integrated within two different blockchain projects.One of these projects goes by the name, Digital Asset, a US-based company that deals with DLT solutions. A part of this sees Google Cloud used along with the Digital Asset's private beta program, one that has been intended to simplify the development of smart contracts. By building partnerships, Google is gaining an access to instant expertise, something that can just have a positive effect later on.The reason behind this step of Google, being a huge news:First, this will help promote blockchain technology to the mainstream. Adoption is a major deal, one that is just going to be upgraded by the name and Google Brand. Basically, people trust Google, and if Google is launching blockchain applications, people will have trust in them as well.In addition, as indicated by the LSE report:\u201cThis will address the gaps that have prevented would-be blockchain solutions from coming to fruition, and considerably speed up the adoption of blockchain technology in doing so. By providing a standardized \u201cbackbone\u201d for smart contracts (which not every application developer knows how to program from scratch), and a \u201csandbox\u201d in which DLT applications can be taken from their alpha version to their launch, Digital Asset and Google are giving blockchain developers everything that they always needed, but could not easily obtain.\u201dIt will quicken the procedure that needs to take place before we can see a completely working blockchain model enter the mainstream, with a couple of glitches, working in a consistent environment.All of this also has implications for \u2018the internet\u2019 as a product too:\u201cKey developments would ensue in the coming years to validate the Internet as a technology suited for mainstream users and make it easier to use. For example, major corporations started to build websites, and Microsoft included the Internet Explorer web browser in releases of Windows 95 as an easy way to use the Internet. Similarly, Google\u2019s movement towards blockchain has the dual effect of providing both their endorsement of the technology in and of itself and making blockchain technology easier to use through its partnership with Digital Assets. In conclusion, Google\u2019s involvement with blockchain will ultimately be a step forward for distributed ledger technologies. Its partnership with Digital Assets will not single-handedly bring blockchain into the mainstream; though it will be a major milestone along the way.\u201dThe blockchain is a development that can't be halted. With Google being in, huge things to happen aren't too far, not only for Google inside the blockchain business but rather for the blockchain technology as a whole as well.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

The government has likewise expressed its expectation to utilize blockchain technology to build transparency and diminish government corruption.Meanwhile, different countries have implemented blockchain ID verification test cases programs in zones like voting from abroad in the US, checking academic degrees in Australia, and government auditing in China.Presently in India, Bankura Municipal Corporation and Durgapur Municipal Corporation will utilize blockchain technology to deal with regulatory tasks, like processing requests and verifying legal identities to make the legal documentation process such as birth certificates more streamlined.Lynked World CEO and Founder Arun Kumar expressed the need for an update of the \"cumbersome\" systems as of now being used for these procedures, saying government offices are still in a position where they require citizens standing before an agent with their ID to access the basic services.Kumar told CCN that the platform is ready for launch and that both West Bengal municipalities will be able to issue birth certs and other legal documents and other certificates as early as September 2018, with 1 million birth certs expected to be placed on blockchain by the end of the year.\u201cThese Birth and other certificates would be digitally authenticated by issuing authorities (municipalities) and that authentication will be stored on blockchain which facilitates verification of these documents by any third party organization to whom owners provide access.Basically, Blockchain would be used to write the hash value of certificate together with the owner of the certificate and who issued it for the authentication and verification.\u201dThe LYNK token will be the local token of the platform and empower the citizens to make applications. The organization specializes in the ID verification through its app which incorporates a digital wallet for storing personal information contained in documents like passports, medical records, academic degrees, and driver\u2019s licenses which can be securely verified on blockchain technology. A QR code is utilized to rapidly associate the citizens with their legal records stored on the blockchain network, thus saving a great amount of time and money that was spent on basic ID verification process.The process to streamline birth certificates and put citizens birth records on the blockchain in India is the most recent in an order of vital steps in adoption that demonstrates the benefits and usefulness of the new technology.Currently, it would be too early to comment on the success of the platform. However, this initiative of massive adoption by different countries is a strong vote of confidence in the Distributed Ledger Technology by ditching the traditional government systems and welcoming the new revolutionary technologies for a better development.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

Beer further clarified the utilization of blockchain technology by the bank:\"We are currently following many paths. We invented a blockchain with an open code based on Ethereum. Actual blockchain technology has not yet resolved issues with privacy and scalability that we needed. We are connected to Hyperledger and Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The application of this technology in business is more important to us than the technology itself. We are looking not only for cost reduction but also for opportunities to develop new products.\u201dBeer was also questioned regarding JP Morgan's position on purchasing cryptocurrencies. She clarified that the bank just supports what is regulated and has experts who are \"evaluating what is happening\" with virtual currencies. When inquired with respect to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Beer preferred not to react.In May, JP Morgan Chase filed a patent for a blockchain powered p2p payments network that could be utilized for intra-and interbank settlements. The patent application proposes utilizing a distributed ledger to process payments continuously, without relying on a trusted third party to hold the genuine \"golden copy\" of the audit trail.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

    "content": "Germany is thinking about a plausibility to launch an independent payment system free of the US which may turn into an exceptionally positive move for Bitcoin.Given the hostile sanctions policy driven by the U.S., Germany, Europe's greatest economy, is intending to present its independent payment system which won't rely upon the United States any longer. Experts believe that this move will highly reinforce the position of Bitcoin.The sanctions recently imposed on Iran and Turkey have prohibited these two nations from the global financial system and made them unfit to carry out transactions with different nations. Such a circumstance seriously affected the attitude of Germany towards the U.S.The German foreign minister Heiko Maas who has been serving in the fourth bureau of Angela Merkel since March of this current year expressed:\u201cFor that reason it\u2019s essential that we strengthen European autonomy by establishing payment channels that are independent of the US, creating a European Monetary Fund and building up an independent Swift system.\u201dEuropean sovereignty may completely reshape the world's monetary scene giving a green light to Bitcoin and crypto. A German-Finnish entrepreneur, known for the improvement of Mega, Kim Dotcom, believes that the withdrawal of European economies from the global banking system can result in the devaluation of the US dollar which in its turn will give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum a part of a strong store of significant worth and medium of exchange.Dotcom stated:\u201cSignificant. German Finance Minister proposes EU monetary fund, EU swift and non-US payment systems. He says its to salvage Iran deal. But it\u2019s really the EU exit from USD dominance. Like I said, USD will collapse. Buy crypto and gold.\u201dGenerally, It is widely believed that cryptocurrency can turn into another alternative to the SWIFT system that can be utilized by the U.S. as an intense tool to control the international banking circle which can be not in the interest of other nations including Europe. In spite of the fact that the SWIFT financial system is situated in Belgium, it can't avoid the U.S. sanctions.However, we can expect that the circumstances will change gradually. Ripple is currently extending its solution coverage which is thought to have the capacity to replace the current SWIFT system soon. As of now, Ripple isn't just launching its operations in Asia and the Middle East yet in addition, heading the converses with various European financial organizations, including major German banks.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

The trade exchanged assets would have followed BTC futures exchanged on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange and exchanged on NYSE Arca.The core reason for which ProShares was rejected is stated as:\u201cThis order disapproves the proposed rule change. Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an\u00a0investment. Rather, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, the Exchange has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6, in particular, the requirement that a national securities exchange\u2019s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.Among other things, the Exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are \u2018markets of significant size.\u2019 That failure is critical because, as explained below, the Exchange has failed to establish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient, and therefore surveillance-sharing with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin is necessary to satisfy the statutory requirement that the Exchange\u2019s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201dThe SEC also rejected ETF proposals from\u00a0GraniteShares and Direxion today, for similar reasons. Check out the full ProShares document from the SEC.Exchange-traded assets track a file or group of assets yet exchange like stocks,\u00a0are generally seen as having the capacity to bring a smash of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency\u00a0market.This recent rejection is similar to that of the denial last month when the SEC rejected a proposition documented by Gemini authors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

    "content": "All the crypto lovers already know that Bitcoin ETF has been topping news this year in the crypto world but do you know that there is a similar product that already exists?The product is similar to Bitcoin ETF and the investors in US markets will be benefited by it as they will be able to allocate more funds into that bitcoin market.Nine companies have currently applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) to work on the bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Two companies named The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and VanEck bitcoin ETFs have the highest probability of being approved by the SEC by early 2019.Now to explain ETFs, they are tradable instruments that are meant for the public and is listed on the stock market. It allows investors to trades the assets and commodities with their brokerage accounts. They can also invest in copper and gold.Investors of cryptocurrency sector including BKCM organizer Brian Kelly and Fundstrat expert Tom Lee have said that launching a bitcoin ETF in US markets will adequately legitimize the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market, opening the cryptocurrency segment to a group of investors who were not ready to put resources into BTC, perhaps because of administrative clashes.Fundstrat founder Tom Lee has also stated that a bitcoin ETF would make cryptocurrency a legal matter as an asset class. However, it is not perfectly true that the traders or investors in the old fiat currency market cannot invest in BTC and cryptocurrencies as a new asset class.But, last year, an ETN in Sweden operated by XBT Provider has been observed with a significant increase in its volume, which surpassed the volume of 80 percent of ETFs in the US.Eric Balchunas, an ETF expert tweeted back in December,\u201cSweden\u2019s bitcoin ETN is now bigger and trades more than about 80% of US ETFs. It hit $700m in aum today while trading $220m this week (insane #s for Sweden)\u201dThe CEO of CoinShares, Ryan Radloff which examines the operation of the ETN, said that the expansion of the ETN from Sweden to the US is an enormous triumph for the Bitcoin sector. He stated,\u201cGiven the current climate on the regulatory front in the U.S., this is a big win for Bitcoin. Everyone that\u2019s investing in dollars can now get exposure to these products, whereas before, they were only available in euros or Swedish krona.\u201dNow the Doubt is whether ETN is as worthy as ETF?Last year, Mark Cuban, who is the billionaire investor and also the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, said in an interview with Bloomberg that he proceeded his first investment in bitcoin through the XBT Provider bitcoin ETN. He said,\u201cIt is interesting because there are a lot of assets which their value is just based on supply and demand. Most stocks, there is no intrinsic value because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. BTC is the same thing. Its value is based on supply demand. I have bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange.\u201dSo, ETN has the similar ability and it provides more of the same liquidity to investors in the US markets so that they can freely invest in the bitcoins in the stock market.What are your views on the Bitcoin ETN and Bitcoin ETF?

The decision was pretty quick.Local crypto exchanges and blockchain-related non-profit associations have started to formally protest against the government of South Korea for its controversial decision to remove cryptocurrency businesses from its tax reduction bill.Earlier this month, the government of South Korea released a proposition entitled \"Venture Enterprise Bill\", a bit of administrative system planned to fuel the development and advancement of small to medium-sized organizations. If passed, the bill will give an extensive variety of advantages to organizations over different enterprises, including 50% of tax reduction.On August 12, the government of South Korea officially made a statement that the blockchain project and cryptocurrency-related business will be taken out of the bill. There are restaurants, bars and event operators that are included in the list that will be taken off from the bill.Local authorities expressed that blockchain projects and cryptocurrency exchanges were wiped out from the bill to prevent a rapid increase in speculation in the new asset class, communicating their worries over the present condition of the cryptocurrency trade market in South Korea.A year ago, in December, the demand for digital assets in the nation flooded to a point in which existing supply of cryptocurrencies on the local trading exchange was not adequate to encourage the exponentially increasing volume driven by new purchasers and examiners.Subsequently, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and other financial offices in South Korea forced a few arrangements to impose with the so-called \"Kimchi Premium\" in the local trade market, which achieved 30 to 40 percent in late 2017.Nine months ago the price of Bitcoin peaked at around $19,500 in the global market, in South Korea.The investors then took over the dominant cryptocurrency at around $24,000, with a premium of 40 percent.As per the statement by local publications, cryptocurrency trading exchanges and blockchain startups requested the government formally and in all ways to re-think on their decision of the elimination of cryptocurrency-related businesses from the bill.Cryptocurrency trades argued that theory inside the crypto trade showcase in December of a year ago was extraordinary, and with new administrative systems made by the FSC set up, the local cryptocurrency trade market won't exhibit such an abnormal state of stability, unpredictability, and speculation.More significantly, cryptocurrency trade administrators argued that the government's new regulatory structure relating to the digital asset sector, which basically recognizes cryptocurrency trades as banks, will constrain digital asset businesses to take safety efforts, internal administration system, and anti-money laundering (AML) strategies used by entirely regulated financial organizations.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

To brief about IELE, it serves as a \u201clower-level\u201d platform which allows the execution of smart contracts from the comparatively higher level languages, namely the solidity language.This is a stage forward for Cardano, as well as for the universe of the blockchain. Out of the blue, engineers will have the capacity to try out the real Cardano innovation which will eventually end up executed into the Cardano stage.This is the second of 2 ongoing testnet dispatches for Cardano. In May 2018, Cardano discharged the KEVM testnet, where the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) was interestingly characterized in the K structure.IELE has 2 sections: a \u201ccorrect-by-construction\u201d VM in the K system (the KEVM), and a Solidity-to-IELE compiler. The compiler takes into consideration programs written in the Solidity language (the programming language used by Ethereum) to be used as an input to the KEVM machine, and in the process will take into account numerous blunders to be distinguished early.IELE will likewise make the written work of brilliant contracts both less demanding and more secure by giving a \u201ccorrect-by-design\u201d system, which will get rid of the errors rapidly which creates a more secure system removing the risk of the failure or hacking issues.Cardano is now planning to release the similar compilers for other equally famous programming languages such as Javascript and Python.This is an enormous advance forward for the Cardano venture. Out of the blue developers can try out Cardano smart contracts. Moreover, they will have the chance to give input to the Cardano group, which will just serve to additionally strengthen the platform all in all.When IELE has been coordinated into the Cardano mainnet, we should hope to see a major increment in intrigue and dapp improvement around the platform.Cardano has likewise been making enormous moves towards decentralization and staking. In the standard Cardano way, they have been adopting an overwhelming academic strategy for their improvement. Cardano has been considering game theory economics to locate the most ideal approach to build up a reasonable staking motivating force to take into account abundant conveyance in the system. Clearly, they have gained some extraordinary ground, as Cardano's originator Charles Hoskinson has just tweeted that proof-of-stake is basically solved.The progression towards decentralization is especially fascinating, as Coinbase has focused on the significance of any coin they list on their trade must be adequately so. In that capacity, Coinbase tweeted a month ago that they are thinking about adding 5 coins to their stage, particularly specifying Cardano as one of them.Moreover, Cardano's next significant breakthrough in the improvement, Goguen, is planned to go live in Q4 2018.The group has been setting strict due dates and meeting them.

MADANA stands for an open data analysis platform, preserving privacy by design. The blockchain-based ecosystem allows anyone to stay in control of their data while monetizing it in an anonymous way, which is the current need of the hour as in the present situations, the data producers hand over their produced data to third parties.Apart from this, Madana also provides a feature where they can give data to Data Analysts for getting a reward which in turn gets processed by the Analysts and once done, it can be sold to third parties.In this way, Madana protects the data from being misused with the help of blockchain technology. Currently, Madana is in the patent-pending process.The project is having a sturdy and sizeable team for the pre-ICO, making a strong foundation of the project which can not only just be an application of LISK but also can be applied beyond the blockchain use cases.Madana has its native token that will be fuelling the Madana data ecosystem, called Privacy Analysis Exchange (PAX) token.

During this presale, PAX tokens will be sold for $0.50.Why Madana Chose LISK?Lisk co-founder Max Kordek and the CEO of Madana, Christian Junger are quite good friends for a long time now.

The scam came out later this week with the news associated with the \u2018free game\u2019 on a gaming platform Steam.Steam which is a social gaming platform allows the users to download a variety of games that are available. There is a wide range of games from all-time classics to the latest genre that is enough to blow your mind. It also includes the trivial indie games that are designed in such a way which will attract the interest of all the gaming-lovers.According to pcgamesn.com, a game known as Abstractism is a concealing cryptocurrency miner:\u201cIt appears that a game marketed on Steam as a \u201crelaxing\u201d and \u201cabsolutely trivial\u201d platformer is, in fact, a prophylactic for some truly grimy money-making ploys. The game has dropped Steam trading items that closely imitate rare items from other games, such as TF2, in an apparent bid to scam item traders. More egregious still, it appears to contain an executable that may help the devs use your computer to mine cryptocurrency, and is flagged as a trojan by several antivirus packages. The game is called Abstractism, and the shady things came to our attention through a YouTube video and a TF2 forum post, both of which dropped over the weekend.\u201dThis is not the first time that a news of illicit mining has come up. Doing it in an improper way can be very easy to inculcate in the everyday life. The downloads and applications which seems to be normal can become a threat to you and an advantage to the malicious miners.This happens as they can then utilize your computer\u2019s power. This process will slow down the computing power and will increase the energy usage which in turn will increase your energy bills. The malware is easy to hide from the users but its very hard to detect, as these miners are really smart.But you can stay away from this malware. The first thing you need to understand is that download anything only from the trusted sources. This step may not be enough to protect your computer so make sure that you have a full-fledged and updated anti-virus software on the computer.Next, always keep a check on the speed of your computer. If you find anything fishy, just investigate and get rid out of any malicious substance or any kind of virus.In these ways only we can fight this crime and push it outwards for a good reason.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

The article is helpful for the companies looking forward to listing the coins on Binance.com.The first tip by CZ is that the CEO of the respective company should fill the Binance Listing Request Form. The reason being that they want to be sure to connect to the decision maker in case some problem rises up.The CEO says that companies sending him white papers or requests to meet are all in vain as he cannot meet every person. He encourages the companies to follow a systematic way.Next, he says, \u201cdon't shill your coin in my tweet comments. It doesn't work. I am inclined to apply a penalty for people/coins doing it, but it may just promote competitors to do so. So I can't do that. But regardless, it doesn't help.\u201dThis means that CZ forbids the companies or the CEOs to spam his posts.The other important point highlighted is that the companies or any person applying for the listing should update the project progress on Binance Info weekly.This technique will help increase the chances of getting listed. People asking for contact person are surely ignored by them.CZ advises the companies to continuously improve their respective services and products. If the company is worthy enough, some person from Binance will be regularly in touch with it.CZ forbids the listing of Big ICOs. The Big ICOs will leverage the extra % of the listing fee. He also discourages the hype marketing. Aggressive marketing is okay, but not the hype marketing.There are few things that are forbidden according to CZ:\u201cWe do not accept teams who publicly speculate on price or make predictions or forecasts on their token\u2019s price.\u201dHe is totally not taking the predictions, so companies Beware!He is also against the companies that use Binance\u2019s name for their gains. Because that is an illegal method of boosting their coin\u2019s price.He also says that people who have already worked for their company are also welcomed and their services are taken into account. The company,\u00a0if listed, cannot disclose it until the whole process is completed. Else they will be then forced to stop the process in the middle.These were few important points that any company should keep in kind before going to Binance for the listing of their coin.Hope that helped you as well!Stay tuned to CoinTopper.com for more updates!",

The new publication has a detailed system in which any data element be it in the form of document, graphic, or database value could be located, accessed, and protected by the help of tokenization.Tokenization uses encryption to process an originally unstoppable data into a stoppable token that can be detokenized only by a specified user. The system uses cryptography to keep together the specific values and data under an authenticated digital signature.The details in the document read, \u201cThe tokenization schema processes the unrestricted content into a corresponding restricted token.

    "content": "Baidu - China's internet search-giant, launched a proprietary token for incentivizing the users of its new blockchain-based photo validating and sharing service.As reported by local news, Baidu announced that Totem - the photo-sharing platform, is now live and it features a dedicated token known as Totem Point, in a press conference held at Beijing. It will be the first blockchain application to run on Baidu's private XuperChain network.Baidu announced that it will initially generate 4 billion Totem tokens with an annual inflation rate of 4.5 percent to encourage individuals and institutions to submit original photographs. Moreover, the whitepaper also revealed today that the number of tokens to be awarded will depend on the type of images submitted by the user.These tokens could be utilized across the different applications on the XuperChain network.

    "content": "In our today's(July 19, 2018) snapshot analysis, we observed the performance of the top cryptocurrencies. Despite the extreme bearish market of 2018, the average price gain of the top viewed cryptocurrencies has been 8-10% when compared with the prices of 2018 till last week. This has given a much-needed relief to the crypto investors and also has risen above the rumors about crypto failure.Let's get back once again to some basics around Cryptocurrency and the need of the DecentralizationFinancial markets today are highly integrated, competitive, distributive and complex. Blockchain technology is all set to radically transform global trade, institutions and firms that govern it.Cryptocurrency has led to a colossal change in the financial world. As this technology finds a new way to upheaval the way we design, make, deliver and coordinate the use of goods and services globally, entrepreneurs have started using artificial intelligence to raise funds for their business.The traditional financial system lacks intelligence and analytical functionality to meet the growing needs of the modern day financial network. Financial institutions like banks have not been able to cater to the financial needs of the people. Rising incidence of defaults, scams make it wary of extending loans to small businesses and to people belonging to lower socio-economic strata. Financial inclusion is another persistent challenge in traditional banking. Companies have to take active decisions based on real-time information. Stakeholders rely on financial systems for real-time, actionable data to plan, define, build and drive performance and growth of their interests. The reliability of data and its application have revolutionized the financial markets. The need of the hour is to boost the traditional banking system to meet the needs of the growing population and adopt fintech to increase the efficiency of the system.Cryptocurrency Use caseBlockchain Technology represents a revolution in how information is gathered and stored. Cryptographic keys provide a new and secure way to manage digital identity that avoids user from sharing too much vulnerable personal information. It automatically creates a record of who has accessed the information and set controls on the permission required to obtain information.World Economic Forum has stated that Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, could soon give rise to a new era of the Internet even more disruptive and transformative than the current one. Blockchain\u2019s ability to generate unprecedented opportunities to create and trade value in society will lead to a generational shift in the Internet\u2019s evolution, from an Internet of Information to a new generation Internet of Value.Beyond just being a trusted repository of information, it could enable regulatory compliance in code form i.e. how blocks are made valid could be a translation of government legal prose into digital code.The most speculated question: Is it a Bubble?The nascency of cryptocurrencies with the unprecedented rise in its popularity had the market capitalization of $42 billion in July 2016 which has crossed $294 billion today, at the press time. These currencies are a trivial fraction of all digital platforms but have experienced an exponential growth.In the recent years, cryptocurrency has led to an emergence of a new speculative behavior with a sudden influx of people calling themselves as crypto- traders and crypto- experts. Over the years, society has been split into two polarised personalities, one that is infatuated by its idea and others that consider it as another bubble.There was around $3 trillion in the game when the dot-com bubble burst but cryptocurrency is still in its nascent stage. Many investors are speculating that it is the largest financial bubble that could decimate the financial market. Though, it's the biggest tech revolution that can transform the way we invest, send money and conduct business.For more updates, stay tuned to CoinTopper.com",

Dexter Hsu who is a Taipei-based analyst at Macquarie Capital says,\u201cInvestors have lost confidence in the smaller platforms, because they have no idea if those companies will survive.\u201d\u00a0He feels that very few firms will be endured in the long run.China's P2P industry, the world's biggest, is one of the most hazardous and slightest directed cuts of the country's sprawling shadow-managing an accountability framework. The government clampdown has weighed on P2P platforms for a long time, however, the weight increased as of late after China's credit markets fixed and the keeping money controller issued a strange cautioning to savers that they ought to be set up to lose all their cash in high return items.The country\u2019s P2P platforms are well established and have about 50 million users that are registered on it. It has the outstanding loan of 1.3 Trillion yuan($195 Billion) with short maturities. The traders normally have to wait for the loans to get facilitated by these platforms to mature before getting their investment back. But some of these traders are now trying to leave the transaction in between by selling their rights to others at a discounted price. Or, they are going to the offices and demanding repayment.The reason for people taking these steps is quite clear. They do not trust these companies as they have seen the drastic results of few people. These P2P platforms are allegedly raising illegal funds and the traders are facing the consequences.Also read: World's largest Asset Manager exploring cryptocurrenciesFor more updates, follow CoinTopper.com",

Not only they are accused of hacking Clinton's campaign but also they hacked the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic National Committee in the fake names DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and “another entity”.\nThe case moved further with the help of the cyber teams in Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.\n\nThe charges that were put are:\n\n1. Count 1: criminal conspiracy\n2. Count 2 - 9: Aggravated identify theft\n3. Count 10: Conspiracy to launder money via cryptocurrency\n4. Count 11: Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States\n\nThe Russian defendants are not in a custody presently, and it isn't clear they will ever show up in the American court, however, the Justice Department has as of late observed an incentive in arraigning foreign hackers in absentia as open prevention.\nFor more updates, follow CoinTopper.com",

Ripple is a successful cryptocurrency and if it wants to rule on the top, it has to bring about certain changes continuously. Ripple is loved by traders as it is easily accessible and has adopted the public opinions at a pace. Ripple also announced it's collaboration with the world's top universities\u00a0some time agoThe new change goes to its leadership team. Ripple initially declared its most up to date Senior Vice President of Business and Corporate Development, Kahina Van Dyke. Her expert vocation has been both expanded and amazing. Van Dyke began as a Membership Sales and Relationship Manager for the Business Council of New York State, straight out of school. She has achieved a lot before coming to Facebook as well. She represented her organization over the world, most conspicuously in Dubai and the UK, until the point that she at long last settled back in the US as the Global Director of Financial Services and Payments Partnerships at Facebook.Kahina Van Dyke wasn't the main official expert Ripple added to its authority group. Swell's Chief Cryptographer, David Schwartz, was named Chief Technology Officer (CTO) around the same time.Schwartz began his own particular organization, David Schwartz Enterprises, 2 years before moving on from the University of Houston. From that point, he worked for the incredibly famous Remax, the land organization, as a product designer. Also, he was a co-founder of Cardiophonics, which is a manufacturing company.These new additions in Ripple are surely indicating one thing that is the bright future of this cryptocurrency.

    "content": "Following quite a while of vulnerability, finally, the clouds are dispersing to reveal that India may not choose to ban cryptocurrencies in totality and rather it may be recommended by the finance ministry panel set up to study them that cryptocurrencies be treated as commodities, one of the seniors in the panel told Quartz yesterday.According to Quartz, the senior official stated that:\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is really thinking of banning cryptocurrencies altogether. The issue here is about regulating the trade and we need to know where the money is coming from. Allowing it as (a) commodity may let us better regulate trade and so that is being looked at,\u201dHe also added that the main concern of the committee lies in tracking the investors and funds to prevent money laundering and illegal financing and expressed that:\u201cTrade is not a criminal offense. Most of us trade in various asset classes in the stock market. So how is this (cryptocurrency trading) any different? What has to be in place is a mechanism to be sure that the money used is not illegal money, and to track its source is the most important thing,\u201dTo this, co-founder of a Pune-based crypto exchange, Shubham Yadav said:\u201cThough cryptocurrencies belong to a new class of financial assets, we can still welcome them as commodities and not currencies because of their high volatile prices. We are also ready to work with the government and assist them on creating a regulatory framework. We can help them in designing a monitoring system for blockchain where it can remotely monitor all transactions\"As reported by Quartz, the former deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India stated that treating cryptocurrencies as commodities would clearly pass a message to investors that such virtual currencies like Bitcoin aren't real currencies. He further added:\u201cIf these are used to settle transactions, then it acquires the nature of currency. So that is one thing that one needs to be wary of. But if people want to invest in a commodity then that is different, because then we can assume that they are aware of the risks involved.\u201dAfter RBI's announcement to stop providing services to any cryptocurrency related business or individual and the recent SC's decision of instructing the banks to discontinue any crypto related services, it now seems that finally, cryptocurrencies would be getting a recognition in India which certainly would be relief-giving to the crypto community in India.For more updates, follow CoinTopper.com",

Bancor has gone offline after a recent hack of $23 million in cryptocurrencies from the exchange.About this hack, Bancor tweeted:\"This morning (CEST) Bancor experienced a security breach. No user wallets were compromised. To complete the investigation, we have moved to maintenance and will be releasing a more detailed report shortly. We look forward to being back online as soon as possible.\"However, in a later tweet by Bancor, they expressed that this incident will be taken seriously and are committing every resource to get the things resolved and tracking the criminals, making the exchange online again.Along with this, the hack stats are also disclosed by Bancor and the stolen numbers, at the press time, are - 24,984 in Ethereum amounting to $11.9- NPXS tokens worth $1 million approx. and - 3.2 million BNT tokens i.e. Bancor\u2019s token, amounting to $10 million.The hacker stole BNT tokens but fortunately, Bancor has an inbuilt mechanism of freezing the funds and the same happened with the stolen BNT tokens, which reduced the loss amount to approx $13 million.Bancor made a statement:\u201cWe were able to freeze the stolen BNT, limiting the damage to the Bancor ecosystem from the theft. The ability to freeze tokens was built into the Bancor Protocol to be used in an extreme situation to recover from a security breach, allowing Bancor to effectively stop the thief from running away with the stolen tokens.\u201dBut freezing other cryptocurrencies was not possible and Bancor commented on that saying:\u201cIt is not possible to freeze the ETH or any other stolen tokens. However, we are now working with dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges to trace the stolen funds and make it more difficult for the thief to liquidate them.\u201dWith more and more ICO scams landing, it's difficult to keep a trusted hand on new companies. To avoid yourself from such ICO scams, refer this guide before investing, however, Bancor has been around for 18 months now after its ICO and also have been updating the users regularly about the status of availability and we can soon expect the services to resume.To know more about Bancor Coin, visit Bancor|CoinTopperFor more updates, follow CoinTopper.com",

One such case has been found in Japan, reported by Daily SPA, where a man named Sora-san was secretly using Free Electricity provided by his company dormitory for mining cryptocurrencies.Sora attempted this by using the electricity provided to him by the company for which he didn't pay anything, thus cutting the considerate charges of mining process in Japan. Sora further explained:\u201cBecause mining requires a huge amount of electricity, the common sense would be to do mining businesses in Mongolia or China, where electricity costs are very low, compared to Japan. But I live in a company dormitory. My electricity costs are null. I thought, I gotta take advantage of this opportunity,\u201dBy doing this, Sora could mine 0.8 Ether monthly which amounts to 50,000 Yen or $500 as his extra monthly income. And he started this mining process six months ago. He said:\u201cOnce it\u2019s set up, I don\u2019t need to do anything, I just let the machine run on its own. It\u2019s really a \u2018free\u2019 income,\u201dAlso worried about the limits of electric power to be consumed so that he wouldn't get caught, Sora said:\u201cI was worried that the dorm manager would notice it, but I was able to figure out the amount of usable watts.\u201d He calculated the cost that would cost more than 20,000 yen ($200).Sora ended the talk by saying laughingly:\u201cNow that I found out that I can mine in my room, I am planning to extend installing miners in the rooms of my close colleagues,\u201d. As he believes that the company dormitory consist of 100 employees, even if the electricity bill rises somewhat higher, it won\u2019t be noticable.What are your views about Sora's way of crypto acquisition?

    "content": "Bitcoin has been witnessing a bearish trend for the past few months and recently saw a huge price drop by hitting the eight-month low of about $5800 and the trend was also called as 'Bloodbath' by some. Just when everything seemed low, the price of bitcoin surged to a nearly $6500 high.It\u2019s nearly 9 percent up in the last 24-hour period, however, at the press time, the stats are something as under:Many are trying to catch the real reason behind this price surge, but to their despair, there are just assumptions and aren't able to find a factual one. This has created an uncertainty of the Bitcoin's future.Arthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX answers - where could Bitcoin\u2019s price be heading next?Hayes made a price prediction, earlier this year of $50,000 by the end of the year and is still standing by it. In an interview recently, on CNBC Fast Money, Hayes cited that:\"I think something that can go up to $20,000 in one year can have a correction down to about $6000. I think it definitely found a bottom \u2026 but with one positive regulatory decision away, to climb to $20,000 or even $50,000 by the end of the year.\"Along with Hayes, many other cryptocurrency personalities have given their Bitcoin price predictions. To cite some, Tim Draper\u00a0predicted $10,000, McAfee Line predicted around $29,000, Tom Lee around $25000, and so on.Hayes also explained, seeing the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market and the number of investors in the crypto space, that:\u201cIn 2013 to 2015, we went for $1,200 to $200. In 2015 to 2017, (we went from) $200 To $20,000. So, we\u2019ve done these sort of moves before. I think the time span is going to shorten because you have many more people involved in the market, who have invested capital and resources to trade this asset class.\u201dSo far, Hayes prediction stands highest. It is seen by some as an exaggerated prediction while some believe it to be a rational one. The reality will be disclosed only by the end of the year.

However, the lawmakers are not paying any attention towards it until the autumn as there are some issues which need to be solved. As per the statement of Anatoliy Aksakov who is the chair of the Duma\u2019s financial markets committee, Cryptocurrency is very complex and he is determined to pass the law by the end of the season.

There are two bills involved, the first one defines digital assets like cryptocurrencies and tokens.

    "content": "The latest report of Virtual Currencies, Monetary Dialogue, July 2018, expresses that the Europian Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee is found to be in support of digital currencies, but not cryptocurrencies.In its clarification, they said that cryptocurrencies use cryptographic functions for the process of verifying and authorizing transactions whereas digital currencies are the ones that are implemented on computer systems. In addition to this, the authors also believe that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin cannot replace the traditional currencies to any significant level as the technology is still facing issues of scalability. Specifically, it would be highly expensive to lead any transaction of fiat through cryptocurrencies.\u00a0The report also mentions that cryptocurrencies have just been a vehicle for financial speculation rather than as a medium of exchange which attracts the speculators for high returns.Also, for the Initial Coin Offerings, the report cites:\"The recent flood of ICOs contains a large number of highly questionable proposals that do notpass muster under traditional due diligence\"Hence, the investors\u00a0are cautioned about the high risks involved in any ICO and also reminds issuers to check whether they fulfill all of their legal obligations, for example in case their conduct constitutes the placement of financial instrumentsHowever, Central Bank Digital Currencies has voted to allow the public to access the central bank money in the non-tangible form and offers free convertibility of CBDC units to cash at 1:1 rate to maintain the price stability. The central bank will be responsible for authorizing and verifying the transactions.With this initiative of Central bank, it is highly likely for the commercial banks to lose the ability to attract deposits. Deposits being the key source of funding for the banks, it would draw a challenge to the reserve banking system if a majority of the customers and businesses would opt for CBDC to hold their liquidity.For more updates, follow CoinTopper.com",

This is the main reason behind the hard fork.According to Zcash website, Overwinter is already seeing substantial support among third parties, including Binance, Bitfinex, Gemini, Poloniex, and others.One of the new feature being introduced in Overwinter is the transaction expiry protocol which closes all the transactions that are in a waiting queue for over an hour to reduce the load that results into a jam many times.The Zcash team additionally guarantees that Zcash will have much faster transactions while keeping up a far superior level of security. Along with this, the team is highly dedicated towards the smooth functioning of Overwinter as its the very first hard fork.

There are\u00a0a\u00a0number of factors responsible for these price movements such as the supply and demand of a particular coin which translates to Lesser the number of coins, higher its price levels and vice versa.Another factor affecting the crypto prices is Market news. Yes, it really impacts a particular coin's performance. Positive or negative news revealing can be a substantial influencer of general market's perceptions and sentiments in regards to a specific coin. Media detailing about a system hack, for instance, is probably going to drive prices down, though, scope about a coin's mass acceptance can bring about the positive market notion that drives a coin's market price upward.Same happens in the case of Stock Market where the stock prices get affected based on the type of News. But amidst all such factors, there are some company stocks that would never really have a huge fluctuation by just any news rolling out and in crypto space, one such company is Binance.The progress of Binance over the timeBinance is a cryptocurrency exchange that host crypto-to-crypto trades. The exchange was set up in 2017 and was initially situated in China. However, due to strict cryptocurrency laws in China, the exchange has since moved to Japan, a crypto-friendly nation!Binance was created by Changpeng Zao, popularly known as CZ. Formerly, CZ used to develop trading software that was used by Tokyo stock exchange, as they had better and fast trading capabilities. This experience of CZ helped him to build Binance, one of the top crypto-exchanges today.Prior to the launch of exchange, Binance had their fund-raising process Before Binance opened their exchange, they fund-raised through an ICO. This is fundamentally the same as crowdfunding, where individuals can contribute to enabling an organization to begin.However, an ICO is quite different, as people invest cryptocurrency instead of real-world money. The Binance ICO raised $15 million, and in return, they gave investors their own cryptocurrency token, which is named the Binance Coin (BNB), which is built on the Ethereum blockchain.Binance has had a very successful start since they were created in 2017 when the actual cryptocurrency boom prevailed. Soon, Binance launched They are now averaging more than $1 billion in daily trades, making them one of the largest exchanges for crypto trading.Binance was said to be moving with the speed of light. The users were quite impressed with the appealing User Interface of the exchange and easy trading services. In fact, Binance grew so quickly, that in January 2018 they had to suspend new registrations. This was because too many people were trying to open a Binance account.\u00a0In one day alone, Binance received over 240,000 new account applications!Other Ventures of Binance:They introduced Binance Labs - It is a blockchain technology incubator where the Binance Team focuses on pre-ICO projects and teams. CZ boasts that his team only welcomes projects that have strong credibility, user base, and liquidity.\u00a0After that, Binance Info - The Codex of Binance, was also launched and completed.And recently Binance officially announced to launch its public blockchain - Binance Chain. The Binance Chain will go live before the end of 2018. Normally, the blockchain network requires gigantic processing power. Therefore, trading on the chain will be expensive and slower when compared to the centralized platform.As per their website:\"As a public blockchain, Binance Chain will mainly focus on the transfer and trading of blockchain assets, as well as provide new possibilities for the future flow of blockchain assets. Binance Chain will focus on performance, ease-of-use, and liquidity. Binance Coin (BNB) will be upgraded to exist on its own blockchain mainnet, becoming a native coin. At the same time, Binance will transition from being a company to a community.\"Besides, Binance is also working on a digital wallet for storage of clients' assets.Current Status of Cryptocurrency MarketThe cryptocurrency market has been taking a series of setbacks. The cryptocurrency prices have also fallen down hard. For instance, Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, went from $1,000 at the start of 2017 to over $20,000 by the year-end. Whereas now it has struck down hard back to below $7,000(at the time of writing).However, a Binance token since its July initial coin offering has soared from about 10 cents to $16 today. Even in this bearish market trend, BNB seems to have maintained its place quite good. Let's see the BNB chart below:\u00a0Binance's Next Move:Just a few days back, Crypto exchange Binance announced their plan to launch the fiat-crypto trading this year. However, Binance.com will continue to remain a crypto-to-crypto exchange and hence, all the crypto-fiat trading will be offered a separate local exchange the company is introducing in Malta.As per the reports, the first crypto-fiat trade will begin with the euro-Bitcoin pair.Binance currently supports 120+ coins, working with 100 plus wallets and 240+ trading pairs.\u00a0CZ added:\"We've received over 5000 applications for coin listings,\"CZ plans to double the size of his existing team to 300 in the next three to six months.To know more about Binance Coin, visit CoinTopper|BinanceCoinLet's see what more wonders, Binance brings ahead!!

    "content": "Kenya is becoming more and more popular for its increasing cryptocurrency acceptance. It launches it's first Bitcoin ATM in Nairobi where crypto users can instantly purchase Bitcoins and Litecoins. The payment for the purchase can be made in both dollars and Kenya shillings.It's the first Bitcoin ATM in the whole of East Africa. South Africa had the first ATM installed almost 4 years ago and since then the number is continuously rising.How does this ATM function?Every crypto trader willing to trade through the ATM must possess an account with a Bitcoin trading platform, however, the ATM also has its inbuilt Bitcoin wallet to store the cryptocurrencies. This wallet will contain your Bitcoin address along with a QR-code which is scanned by the ATM for a valid authorization. Once done, the user can deposit the cash and click on the 'Buy' button and the tokens will successfully be shown in the wallet.Bitcoin entrepreneur, Wangechi Kariuki also spoke about the ATM:\"The transaction is simple, taking less than two minutes; You can get as many Bitcoins as the value of your cash. Bitcoins function just like the loyalty points we earn from shopping at supermarkets or the reward points we get from talk time. You can also use them to buy goods or pay for services.\"As per the reports, the ATM has comparatively higher exchange rates which are being looked upon and plans are being made to include M-Pesa as a payment option to curb this concern.The ATM currently serves 15-20 people a day and the count keeps growing. On this growing trend of Kenya, the Chairman of Kenya\u2019s Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence, Dr. Bitange Ndemo says:\u201cThis is a fast growing technology. A few years back we approached mobile money with the same caution we have for the cryptocurrency. But look where we are now\u2026We will soon submit our recommendations from the development of the country\u2019s first blockchain-based cryptocurrency.\u201dHowever, the Governor of Central Bank of Kenya is still having some concerns regarding the risks involved and its impact on the country's financial stability.Finally, Kariuki concluded the matter by saying that with any online transaction, the vulnerability issues prevail and that the users must make sure of their security before transacting with the people.For more updates, follow CoinTopper.com",

However, ICOs remain to be considered as securities under the regulation of SEC.Hinman went ahead to clarify that the biggest test for classifying the cryptocurrencies and ICOs as securities is whether there is a desire of profit from the third party or not. And if the crypto-investors are desiring the same, then cryptocurrency can be given the class of 'securities'.He stated:\"Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers,\"The reason for not classifying Bitcoin and Ethereum as Securities was its higher level of decentralization. Whereas, for an object to be classed in Securities, it needs to possess a greater level of centralization. Hence, the classification of BTC and ETH was obvious.The news was quite as expected for Bitcoin, as there were previously good statements made on the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency classification by Jay Clayton, the Chairman of SEC.

In any case, there is an issue, as a rule, it is complicated for institutional and traditional investors to find regulated exchanges and or financial institutions that offer crypto-related investments.\nAnd, this is the reason why Goldman Sachs is putting resources into experts that will enable the bank to build its crypto-related offers to its customers.\nTiffany Galvin-Cohen, Bank Spokeswomen remarked: \n    “In response to client interest in various digital products, we are exploring how best to serve them in the space. We have not reached a conclusion on the scope of our digital asset offering.”\nBanks will need to adapt to this new market if they want to keep attracting investors and clients.",

    "content": "Will it happen today?\nWould we be able to finally observe Ripple hit the $1.00 target?\nIt's clever isn't it, fourteen days prior, in the event that some individual disclosed to you, Ripple would hit $1.00 amidst April you may have chuckled. Truly, it looked outlandish. Through Ripple's own low value as well as besides, through the poor state of the markets. Basically, negativity assumed control, I trust this is something we are generally blameworthy of applying.\nThe irritating thing about this is at the present time, with Ripple wavering on the edge of $1.00, those 'experts' who called it and said 'Ripple will hit $1.00 in 17 and a large portion of days' or whatever, will now encounter that egotistical inclination, the sentiment 'I disclosed to you so' despite the fact that extremely, their estimations may just have been down to premonition and fortuitous event.\nIn any case, it would seem that their premonitions made them bear. Much appreciated!\nHow is Ripple getting along today?\nAt the time of composing this article, Ripple is valued at $0.913 and is up 4.77%. There is a little approach yet with the correct conditions, Ripple could hit $1.00 soon. With another bull run anticipated and the markets proposing that the following bull run could be soon, we ought to anticipate that Ripple will take after on, with XRP climbing to $1.00 within the near future.\nWe realize that generally speaking, the Ripple community is going for a value of around $3.00 for XRP, this would set Ripple up well regarding its objectives to incorporate XRP into payment and money transfer alternatives. $3.00 takes into consideration straightforward change rates and obviously, makes the currency exceptionally reasonable, along these lines enabling more individuals to make purchases.\nWe likewise realize that a few holders are calling for Ripple to hit $10.00 in any case, I figure this would give a weakness to Ripple, as far as their adoption plans are concerned. $10.00 is as yet reasonable, yet it makes the currency far more expensive and a greater amount of an 'investment' as it were. The holders requiring this obviously need $10.00 to happen, essentially so they can create an immense profit for their investment. That is sensible on account obviously, that is the reason the majority of individuals trade in cryptocurrencies.\nAlong these lines, with Ripple so near $1.00, we do hope to see this objective broke soon. Get the atmosphere right, and the numbers will take after. Should we see another bull run soon, Ripple will stick to this same pattern and climb? When it hits $1.00, intrigue will crest again and perhaps, quite possibly, Ripple will treat us to some more data about their never-ending partnership programs, who knows!",

    "content": "Making online payments is possible through various ways. Cryptocurrencies play a developing part of significance in such manner. Taking the crown from any semblance of PayPal won't occur instantly. All things considered, the latter company is rolling out some policy improvements which won't be to everybody's loving.\nPayPal's Policy Changes\nOnline payment processors need to watch out for their rivals. This additionally incorporates rolling out policy improvements which may outrage a reasonable amount of members. For PayPal, their new direction(https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full) is quite clear. The variable rate pricing for sending cash outside of the US is being discarded. Rather, beneficiaries of funds will be discriminated based on their nation of residence. A flat charge is to be introduced, which can increase up to $4.99 per transaction.\nMaking the situation worse, there is an additional \"rule\" for credit and debit card clients. This same flat expense will apply, in addition to a settled charge based on the currency, and an extra charge of 2.9% of the transaction amount. In the best case, sending $100 to a nation with a $2.99 flat charge would net the beneficiary $92 or less. This new plan won't be to the preferring of individuals who routinely exchange cash through the PayPal foundation.\nIt is imperative to take note of this does not have any significant bearing to the purchases made through the service. This exclusively relates to individuals who send cash to their family or friends. Anything named as a non-purchase will be liable to this new policy. This makes PayPal a far less ideal alternative for sending cash amongst loved ones. Rather, it might push individuals to alternative solutions.\nA Boost for Cryptocurrency?\nAs of not long ago, PayPal had made some level of impact in the money transfer industry. Particularly where settlements are concerned, the administration offers a sufficient option. These new changes will drive individuals to search for options in such manner. Particularly with unverified users being not able to send cash and make payments, things are not heading the correct way.\nDifferent types of settlement will without a doubt advantage from these policy changes. The likes of TransferWise are considerably less expensive than PayPal, yet somewhat costly too. Cryptocurrencies can have a beneficial outcome in such cases. Not at all like conventional arrangements, Bitcoin and consorts are borderless and can be a great deal less expensive to send cash to another country.\nMore significantly, cryptocurrency doesn't really require a great deal of personal information. Setting up a wallet address involves installing just the right software. Converting cryptocurrency to fiat money may include a KYC method, yet exchanges are showing signs of improvement at handling those processes rapidly. PayPal may successfully be ready for more extensive cryptocurrency adoption in the coming years.",
